## Le t 's b eg i n

In the play 'If I Were You', you have read how Gerrard outsmarts the intruder with his 'presence of mind'. The intruder wanted to steal Gerrard's identity.

In our day-to-day life we share personal information like telephone number, house address, mobile number, date of birth, e-mail address, etc., everyday with people whom we may not know very well.

Don't you think it is not safe to share information in today's digital age? Someone like the intruder in the play 'If I Were You' might misuse your unique and personal identity details. This is called identity theft.

The cases of online identity thefts are increasing day by day. Collect information about cases of identity theft and share it in the class.

#### **Interview with a Detective**

His appearance was clean, cool and deliberately ambiguous. Under the sanctuary of his aviators, his eyes silently scanned the room. He is a Manhattan-based, third-generation private detective who's been in the business for more than three decades — specialising in surveillance and being an overall mystery-tinged badass. We asked him everything we've ever wanted to know about the profession.

Unit 9.indd 124 20-02-2023 09:29:55

| Interviewer : | So, what exactly do you do? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detective : | I do a lot of surveillance. Basically, |  |
|  | someone who wonders, "What is this |  |
|  | other person up to?" If it's insurance |  |
|  | company (surveying someone on |  |
|  | workers' compensation), they'll ask, "Is |  |
|  | he back working?" Things like that. |  |
|  | Another very common request is | surveillance: close |
|  | locating people, and it could be for a lot | observation, especially of a |
|  | of reasons. I had a case recently, a man | suspected spy or criminal |
|  | hadn't been in touch with his mother for |  |
|  | 20 years and I helped him find her. |  |
| Interviewer : | What kind of skills make for a good PI |  |
|  | (Private Investigator)? |  |
| Detective : | Patience— Number one. You have to |  |
|  | pay attention. You have to be the kind |  |
|  | of person, if you sit in front of a door |  |
|  | watching it for six hours, and you haven't |  |
|  | seen your guy. |  |
|  | You have to plan accordingly, and be |  |
|  | willing to make sacrifices in order to stay |  |
|  | out there. It's not a job for people who |  |
|  | want to slack off. |  |
| Interviewer : | If you needed to locate someone, what's |  |
|  | the ideal information you need to start? |  |
| Detective : | Usually, this is what I tell people, "If you |  |
|  | want to find someone, I need the name |  |
|  | with the exact spelling, the DOB if you |  |
|  | know it, the social security number, | DOB: Date of Birth |
|  | and a last known, official address where |  |
|  | they've lived within the past 15 years." |  |
|  | Because that means they'll be in our |  |
|  | database. |  |
| Interviewer : | Do most private investigators have a |  |
|  | relationship with local police? |  |
| Detective : | I would say that's kind of a myth. Most |  |
|  | cops wouldn't even do it in the first |  |
|  | place, because they know how serious a |  |
|  | violation it is. |  |
| Interviewer : | Do most private eyes carry guns? |  |
| Detective : | I don't think so. We don't kill people but |  |
|  | help them. |  |

|  | Interviewer : What do films and television shows get |
| --- | --- |
|  | wrong about being a PI? |
|  | Detective : The big difference is, the things you see |
|  | in films do happen to private detectives, |
|  | but they're shrinking down maybe 20 |
|  | years of adventure into an episode. After |
|  | 30 years, I probably have one good movie |
|  | worth of experiences. |

#### Listen to the story of Shibi Rana and answer the questions that follow.

There are many stories in our mythology when gods have disguised themselves in the forms of human beings, birds, etc. This is done either to test the efficiency and ability of the kings or to see if people are happy and contented on earth. This is another aspect of changing the identity. Let us listen to story of King Shibi.

There was a great king, Shibi Rana who had immense power then, even gods in heavens were amazed. They feared that Shibi might take away their kingdoms. They devised a plan to test his sense of justice. So they decided to reach Shibi's kingdom in disguise.

One day, Shibi Rana was sitting on his throne. His courtroom was surrounded by majestic gardens. There came a scared dove flying to him and it was followed by a fierce looking eagle. The king gave shelter to the dove and saved her. The eagle argued that the king has taken away his food — the dove. It would starve. The king assured the eagle that he would give equal quantity of any other food. The eagle asked for King Shibi's flesh. The magnanimous king agreed with a smile. A balance was brought in the court. It was soon found that with each addition of the king's flesh the dove grew heavier. The equal balance was not arrived at. But the king remained calm and unperturbed.

The Gods in the guise of dove and eagle were assured of Shibi's righteousness. The forms of the eagle and the dove soon disappeared. In their place stood Indra, the king of the Gods and Agni, the God of fire smiling and blessing the king for his benevolence and greatness.
