### **Reading Comprehension**

## **Text I**

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

Vishav Driman (65 year old) and her husband Kamal Jeet (69 year old) set out to discover the hidden treasure of Uttarakhand by bicycle. Vishav shares their post-retirement adventure.

#### **Pedalling through the Golden Years**

At a time when our peers were slowing down, relaxing and watching sunsets from their front porch, we found a new passion—cycling. We started out with short daily rides, but found ourselves looking forward to them more and more, so much that we decided to venture further and cover more ground. There were obvious health concerns—the risk of performing a physically strenuous activity at a high altitude, the most obvious of them. But it helped that we had lived in Uttarakhand's capital, Dehradun, our entire lives, and were therefore acclimatised to the cold winds and narrow winding roads that characterise this

beautiful state. We were also familiar with almost all the scenic mountain trails it had to offer.

Short rides extended to longer ones as we started falling deeper in love with not just the sport, but the very idea of discovering a world we had always been a part of, but never had the time to explore. Soon, a simple hobby turned into a project of sorts, and we started participating in cyclotrons and other cycling events being held in the city. Admiration and encouragement poured in from family members, friends and neighbours along the way, sparking a new thought—was it possible to travel across the state on our bicycles? It seemed daunting at first, but we knew we had to try. Our gear in place, our bikes serviced, and our minds set, we set off on an adventure we would remember for the rest of our lives.

In my opinion, there are very few ways to enjoy and appreciate the beauty of Uttarakhand and cycling is the most thrilling of them all. Sunlight filtering through the trees and a cool breeze gently caressing your faces as you ride, coupled with breathtaking views of sal forests spread like a green cover on the mountains and surrounding valleys, the experience of pedalling across the state is truly inexplicable. Of the many trails we navigated, there is one that occupies a special place in our hearts. It began from *Ghanta Ghar*, a popular tourist attraction in Dehradun, it took us through

![](_page_2_Picture_1.jpeg)

some of the most picturesque locations of the state such as Kimadi, Hathi Paon, Mussoorie and Chaar Dukaan, right up to George Everest point. This 100km ride (approximately) is also one of the few routes in Uttarakhand that encapsulates all the element that one expects while cycling here—steep slopes, sharp curves, endless hills, lush forests, and off-road experiences.

**Read the poem given below and answer the questions that follow.**

**Going Down Hill on a Bicycle**, **A Boy's Song**

With lifted feet, hands still, I am poised, and down the hill Dart, with heedful mind; The air goes by in a wind. Swifter and yet more swift, Till the heart with a mighty lift

heedful poised slackens and Understand

Unit-7.indd 96 20-02-2023 09:42:39

Makes the lungs laugh, the throat cry:— "O bird, see; see, bird, I fly.

"Is this, is this your joy? O bird, then I, though a boy, For a golden moment share Your feathery life in air!"

Say, heart, is there aught like this In a world that is full of bliss? 'Tis more than skating, bound Steel-shod to the level ground.

Speed slackens now, I float Awhile in my airy boat; Till, when the wheels scarce crawl, My feet to the treadles fall.

Alas, that the longest hill Must end in a vale; but still, Who climbs with toil, wheresoe'er, Shall find wings waiting there.

# Listening

 1. Following is a passage on Mizoram and its people. When one visits this place, one is enchanted by its natural beauty and the vibrant culture of the state. Listen to the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the recorded story or ask your teacher, sibling or friend to read the story aloud.

#### **Mizoram**

Once a tourist remarked, "I visited the Eastern States this time—where the people talk in songs and they always dance."

Unit-7.indd 100 20-02-2023 09:42:40

The eastern region of India is no doubt charmingly novel in many of its features. Mizoram, literally the land of Mizos is an expanse of blue-green hills. Mizoram is broken up lenghwise into five major mountain ranges gradually descending from the south to the north. The hills are rugged and their heights uneven. The name of the state Mizoram is made of two words. 'Mi' means human beings, 'Zo' means a hill. So, a 'Mizo' is a human dweller of a hill; Mizoram means the land of the hilldwellers. Aizawl is the capital town of the State built in tiers along the hill.

The Mizos have three main festivals—Mim Kut, Chapchar Kut and Pawl Kut. These festivals are associated with their agricultural activities during which they enjoy life by singing and dancing. The Mizos, blessed as they are with a beautiful environment and rich culture, are a vibrant and social people. They love to dance as much as they love to sing. They boast a number of folk and community dances handed down from one generation to the other through the ages. The dances are expressions of the gay, carefree spirit of the Mizos. It should be noted here that these dances are not intended for stage performance, rather they have been evolved for community involvement and participation.

These are the different ways in which the characters have spoken. These show the mood, emotion, and intention of the characters.
 Now, write the dialogues and then in groups of three, enact it as a skit in the class.
