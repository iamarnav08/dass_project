A company raises its capital by means of issue of shares. But the funds raised by the issue of shares are seldom adequate to meet their long term financial needs of a company. Hence, most companies turn to raising long-term funds also through debentures which are issued either through the route of private placement or by offering the same to the public. The finances raised through debentures are also known as long-term debt. This chapter deals with the accounting treatment of issue and redemption of debentures and other related aspects.

### **SECTION I**

### **2.1 Meaning of Debentures**

*Debenture*: The word 'debenture' has been derived from a Latin word 'debere' which means to borrow. Debenture is a written instrument acknowledging a debt under the common seal of the company. It contains a contract for repayment of principal after a specified period or at intervals or at the option of the company and for payment of interest at a fixed rate payable usually either half-yearly or yearly on fixed dates. According to section 2(30) of The Companies Act, 2013 'Debenture' includes Debenture Inventory, Bonds and any other securities of a company whether constituting a charge on the assets of the company or not.

*Bond:* Bond is also an instrument of acknowledgement of debt. Traditionally, the Government issued bonds, but these days, bonds are also being issued by semi-government and non-governmental organisations. The terms 'debentures' and 'Bonds' are now being used inter-changeably.

### **2.2 Distinction between Shares and Debentures**

*Ownership*: A 'share' represents ownership of the company whereas a debenture is only acknowledgement of Debt. A share is a part of the owned capital whereas a debenture is a part of borrowed capital.

*Return:* The return on shares is known as dividend while the return on debentures is called interest. The rate of return on shares may vary from year to year depending upon the profits of the company but the rate of interest on debentures is prefixed. The payment of dividend is an appropriation of profits, whereas the payment of interest is a charge on profits and is to be paid even if there is no profit.

*Repayment:* Normally, the amount of shares is not returned during the life of the company, whereas, generally, the debentures are issued for a specified period and repayable on the expiry of that period.

*Voting Rights:* Shareholders enjoy voting rights whereas debentureholders do not normally enjoy any voting right.

*Security :* Shares are not secured by any charge whereas the debentures are generally secured and carry a fixed or floating charge over the assets of the company.

*Convertibility:* Shares cannot be converted into debentures whereas debentures can be converted into shares if the terms of issue so provide, and in that case these are known as convertible debentures.

### **2.3 Types of Debentures**

A company may issue different kinds of debentures which can be classified as under:

### *2.3.1 From the Point of view of Security*

- *(a) Secured Debentures*: Secured debentures refer to those debentures where a charge is created on the assets of the company for the purpose of payment in case of default. The charge may be fixed or floating. A fixed charge is created on a specific asset whereas a floating charge is
on the general assets of the company. The fixed charge is created against those assets which are held by a company for use in operations not meant for sale whereas floating charge involves all assets excluding those assigned to the secured creditors.

- *(b) Unsecured Debentures*: Unsecured debentures do not have a specific charge on the assets of the company. However, a floating charge may be created on these debentures by default. Normally, these kinds of debentures are not issued.
### *2.3.2 From the Point of view of Tenure*

- *(a) Redeemable Debentures:* Redeemable debentures are those which are payable on the expiry of the specific period either in lump sum or in Instalments during the life time of the company. Debentures can be redeemed either at par or at premium.
- *(b) Irredeemable Debentures:* Irredeemable debentures are also known as *Perpetual Debentures* because the company does not give any undertaking for the repayment of money borrowed by issuing such debentures. These debentures are repayable on the winding-up of a company or on the expiry of a long period.

### *2.3.3 From the Point of view of Convertibility*

- *(a) Convertible Debentures:* Debentures which are convertible into equity shares or in any other security either at the option of the company or the debentureholders are called convertible debentures. These debentures are either fully convertible or partly convertible.
- *(b) Non-Convertible Debentures:* The debentures which cannot be converted into shares or in any other securities are called nonconvertible debentures. Most debentures issued by companies fall in this category.

### *2.3.4 From Coupon Rate Point of view*

- *(a) Specific Coupon Rate Debentures*: These debentures are issued with a specified rate of interest, which is called the coupon rate. The specified rate may either be fixed or floating. The floating interest rate is usually tagged with the bank rate.
- *(b) Zero Coupon Rate Debentures*: These debentures do not carry a specific rate of interest. In order to compensate the investors, such debentures are issued at substantial discount and the difference between the nominal value and the issue price is treated as the amount of interest related to the duration of the debentures.

### *2.3.5 From the view Point of Registration*

- *(a) Registered Debentures*: Registered debentures are those debentures in respect of which all details including names, addresses and particulars of holding of the debentureholders are entered in a register kept by the company. Such debentures can be transferred only by executing a regular transfer deed.
- *(b) Bearer Debentures*: Bearer debentures are the debentures which can be transferred by way of delivery and the company does not keep any record of the debentures Interest on debentures is paid to a person who produces the interest coupon attached to such debentures.

### **Types of Debenture/Bond**

### **2.4 Issue of Debentures**

The procedure for the issue of debentures is the same as that for the issue of shares. The intending investors apply for debentures on the basis of the prospectus issued by the company. The company may either ask for the entire amount to be paid on application or by means of instalments on application, on allotment and on various calls. Debentures can be issued at par, at a premium or at a discount. They can also be issued for consideration other than cash or as a collateral security.

### *2.4.1 Issue of Debentures for Cash*

Debentures are said to be issued at par when their issue price is equal to the face value. The journal entries recorded for such issue are as under:

| (a) | If whole amount is received in one instalment: |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (i) On receipt of the application money |  |
|  | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Debenture Application & Allotment A/c |  |
|  | (ii) On Allotment of debentures |  |
|  | Debenture Application & Allotment A/c | Dr. |

| (b) | If debenture amount is received in two instalments: |  |
|  | (i) On receipt of application money |  |
|  | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Debenture Application A/c |  |
|  | (ii) For adjustment of applications money on allotment |  |

|  | (iv) On receipt of allotment money |  |
|  | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Debenture Allotment A/c |  |
| (c) | If debenture money is received in more than two instalments |  |
|  | Additional entries: |  |
|  | (i) On making the first call |  |
|  | Debenture First Call A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Debentures A/c |  |
|  | (ii) On the receipt of the first call |  |
|  | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Debenture First Call A/c |  |

*Note:* Similar entries may be made for the second call and final call. However, normally the whole amount is collected on application or in two instalments, i.e., on application and allotment.

### *2.4.2 Issue of Debentures at a Discount*

When a debenture is issued at a price below its nominal value, it is said to be issued at a discount. For example, the issue of Rs. 100 debentures at Rs. 95, Rs. 5 being the amount of discount. The discount on issue of debentures can be written off either by debiting it to or out of Securities Premium Reserve, if any, during the life time of debentures.

 Discount on issue of debentures to be written off within 12 months of the balance sheet date or the period of operating cycle is shown under 'Other Current Assets' and the part which is to be written off after 12 months of balance sheet is shown under 'Other Non-Current Assets'.

The Companies Act, 2013 does not impose any restrictions upon the issue of debentures at a discount.

### *2.4.3 Debentures issued at Premium*

A debenture is said to be issued at a premium when the price charged is more than its nominal value. For example, the issue of Rs. 100 debentures for Rs. 110, (Rs. 10 is being the premium). The amount of premium is credited to Securities Premium Reserve account and is shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet under the head "Reserves and Surpluses".

### **2.5 Over Subscription**

When the number of debentures applied for is more than the number of debentures offered to the public, the issue is said to be over subscribed. A company, however, cannot allot more debentures than it has invited for subscription. The excess money received on over subscription may, however, be retained for adjustment towards allotment and the respective calls to be made. But the money received from applicants to whom no debentures have been allotted, will be refunded to them.

Sometimes a company may purchase the assets as well as takeover its liabilities of another concern. It happens usually in case of purchase of the whole business of the other concern. In such a situation, the purchase consideration will be equal to the value of net assets (Assets - Liabilities) taken over, and if the whole amount of the consideration is paid by issue of debentures, the journal entry for purchase of business will be:

In case of the whole business being taken over if the amount of debentures issued is more than the amount of the net assets taken over, the difference (excess) will be treated as value of goodwill and the same shall also be debited while passing the journal entry for the purchase of vender's business (see Illustration 11). But if it is the other way round, i.e., the value of debentures is less than the value of the net assets taken over the difference will be credited to capital Reserve accounts (See Illustration 12).

### **2.7 Issue of Debentures as a Collateral Security**

A collateral security may be defined as a subsidiary or secondary or additional security besides the primary security when a company obtains a loan or overdraft from a bank or any other financial Institution. It may pledge or mortgage some assets as a secured loan against the said loan. But the lending institutions may insist on additional assets as collateral security so that the amount of loan can be realised in full with the help of collateral security in case the amount from the sale of principal security falls short of the loan money. In such situation, the company may issue its own debentures to the lenders in addition to some other assets already pledged. Such an issue of debentures is known as 'Debentures issued as Collateral Security'.

If the company fails to repay the loan along with interest, the lender is free to receive his money from the sale of primary security and if the realisable value of the primary security falls short to cover the entire amount, the lender has the right to invoke the benefit of collateral security whereby debentures may either be presented for redemption or sold in the open market.

Debentures issued as collateral security can be dealt within two ways in the books of the company:

### *First Method*

No entry is made in the books of accounts since no liability is created by such issue. However, on the liability side of the balance sheet, below the item of loan, a note to the effect that it has been secured by issue of debentures as a collateral security is appended. For example, X Company has issued 9%, 10,000 debentures of Rs.100 each for a loan of Rs.10, 00,000 taken from a bank. This fact may be shown in the balance sheet as under:

|  | Balance Sheet as at __________ |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Particulars | Note | Amount |
|  | No. | (Rs.) |
| I. Equity and Liabilities |  |  |
| 1. Non-current Liabilities |  |  |
| Long-term borrowings | 1 | 10,00,000 |

### Notes to Accounts

|  | Bank Loan |
|  | (Secured by issue of 10,000, 10% debentures 10,00,000 |
|  | of Rs. 10 each as Collatoral Security) |

### *Second Method*

The issue of debentures as a collateral security may be recorded by means of journal entry as follows:

*Journal Entries*

- *i. Issue of 10,000, 9% debentures of Rs. 100 each as collateral security for bank loan of Rs. 10,00,000.*
	- Debenture Suspense A/c Dr. 10,00,000 To 9% Debentures A/c 10,00,000
- *ii. For cancellation of 9% debentures as collateral security on repayment of bank loan.*

Debenture Suspense account will appear as a deduction from the debentures in notes to accounts of long-term borrowings. When loan is repaid the above entry will be cancelled by a reverse entry :

9% Debentures A/c Dr. 10,00,000

To Debenture Suspense A/c 10,00,000

### **2.8 Terms of Issue of Debentures**

When a company issues debentures, it usually mentions the terms on which they will be redeemed on their maturity. Redemption of debentures means discharge of liability on account of debentures by repayment made to the debenture holders. Debentures can be redeemed either at par or at a premium.

Depending upon the terms and conditions of issue and redemption of debentures, the following six situations are commonly found in practice.

- (i) Issued at par and redeemable at par
- (ii) Issued at discount and redeemable at par
- (iii) Issued at a premium and redeemable at par
- (iv) Issued at par and redeemable at a premium
- (v) Issued at a discount and redeemable at a premium
- (vi) Issued at a premium and redeemable at a premium

In all the above six cases, the following journal entries will be passed:

### **2.9 Interest on Debentures**

When a company issues debentures, it is under an obligation to pay interest thereon at fixed percentage (half yearly) periodically until debentures are repaid. This percentage is usually as part of the name of debentures like 8% debentures, 10% debentures, etc., and interest payable is calculated at the nominal value of debentures.

Interest on debenture is a charge against the profit of the company and must be paid whether the company has earned any profit or not. According to Income Tax Act, 1961, a company must deduct income tax at a prescribed rate from the interest payable on debentures if it exceeds the prescribed limit. It is called Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and is to be deposited with the tax authorities. Of course, the debentureholders can adjust this amount against the tax due from them.

- 3. Purchase in the open market
- 4. By conversion into shares or new debentures.

![](_page_35_Figure_8.jpeg)

*Payment in lump sum :* The company redeems the debentures by paying the amount in lump sum to the debentureholders at the maturity thereof as per terms of issue.

*Payment in instalments* **:** Under this method, normally redemption of debentures is made in instalments on the specified date during the tenure of the debentures. The total amount of debenture liability is divided by the number of years. It is to note that the actual debentures redeemable are identified by means of drawing the requisite number of lots out of the debentures outstanding for payment.

*Purchase in open market:* When a company purchases its own debentures for the purposes of cancellation, such an act of purchasing and cancelling the debentures constitutes redemption of debentures by purchase in the open market.

*Conversion into shares or new debentures :* A company can redeem its debentures by converting them into shares or new class of debentures. If debentureholders find that the offer is beneficial to them, they can exercise their right of converting their debentures into shares or new class of debentures.

These new shares or debentures can be issued at par, at a discount or at a premium. It should be noted that only the actual proceeds of debentures are to be taken into account for ascertaining the number of shares to be issued in lieu of the debentures to be converted. If debentures were originally issued at discount, the actual amount realised from them at the time of issue would be used as the basis for computing the actual number of shares to be issued. It may be noted that this method is applicable only to convertible debentures.

The following factors should be taken into consideration by the company at the time of redemption of debentures :

- **1. Time of redemption of debentures :-** Generally, debentures are redeemed on due date but a company may redeem its debentures before maturity date, if its articles provides for such.
- **2. Sources of Redemption of debentures :-** A company may source its redemption of debentures either out of capital or out of profits.

As per the Act, all India financial institutions registered by Reserve Bank of India, banking companies, NFBCs registered with Reserve bank of India, Housing Finance companies registered to the National Housing bank and the companies listed on stock exchange and unlisted companies are exempted from creating Debenture Redemption Reserve and may redeem debentures out of capital. Whereas for "other unlisted companies", the adequacy of Debenture Redemption Reserve shall be ten percent of the value of the outstanding debentures.

However companies are required to invest or deposit a sum on or before April 30 which shall not be less than 15% of the amount of debentures maturing during the year ending on March 31 of the next year in anyone or more methods of investments or deposits given below:

- (i) Deposit with any scheduled bank, free from any charge or line;
- (ii) Securities of the Central Government or of any State Government;
- (iii) Securities mentioned in sub clauses (a) to (d) and (ee) of section 20 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1982;
- (iv) Bonds issued by any other company which is notified under subclause (f) of section 20 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1982;
- (v) The amount invested or deposited as above shall not be used for any purpose other than for redemption of debentures maturing during the year referred above;

In case the debentures are redeemed in lump sum a company will invest 15% of the of the value of debentures. However, if the debentures are to be redeemed in installment, over a period, investment shall not be realised but carried forward to meet the requirement of debenture Redemption Investment for the next redemption. It must be at least 15% of the value of the debentures to be redeemed in the next year. However, if debenture redemption investment is more or less than 15% of the value of debentures to be redeemed, Debenture Redemption Investment shall be realised to the extent they are excess and further amount shall be invested to meet the shortfall in the investment. For example, Kays Ltd. has 10,000, 60% debentures to be redeemed as follows:

| On January 31, 2017 | 2,000 Debentures |
| --- | --- |
| January 31, 2018 | 3,000 |
| January 31 , 2019 | 3,000 |
| January 31 , 2020 | 2,000 |

The amount will be invested or realised during the above 4 years as:

- (i) Kays Ltd., will invest Rs. 30,000 on or before April 30, 2016 for redemption of 2,000 debentures on January 31, 2017.
- (ii) It will further invest Rs. 15,000 on or before April 30, 2017 to make the investment equal to Rs. 15,000 on or before April 30, 2017 to make the investment equal to Rs. 45,000, i.e., 15% of Rs. 3,00,000 the debentures to be redeemed on January 31, 2018.
- (iii) Investment in debenture redemption as on April 20, 2018 will be Rs. 45,000 which meets the criteria of investment being 15% of debentures (Rs. 3,00,000) to be redeemed during the year. At the time of redemption of debentures on January 31, 2019 it will realise debentures redemption investments of Rs, 15,000. After realisation of investments, balance investments will be Rs. 30,000 which is equal to 15% Rs. 200,000.
- (iv) At the time of redemption of 2,000 debentures on January 31, 2020 all the investments will be realised.

### **2.12 Redemption by Payment in Lump Sum**

### *Summary*

*Debenture:* Debenture is the acknowledgements of debt. It is a loan capital raised by the company from general public. A person/holder of such a written acknowledgement is called 'debenture holder'.

*Bond:* Bond is similar to debenture in terms of contents and texture. The only difference is with respect of issue condition, i.e, bonds can be issued without pre-determined rate of interest as it is in case of deep discount bonds.

*Charge:* Charge is an incumbrance to meet the obligation under trust deed on certain assets which company agrees to mortgage either by way of first or second charge. First charge implies the priority in repayment of loan. Those who hold first charge against any specific asset will realise their claim from the net realisable value of such assets. Any amount of surplus from such assets given under first charge will be utilised for setting the claims for holder of second charge.

*Types of Debenture:* Debentures are of various types such as: secured and unsecured debentures redeemable and perpetual debentures, convertible and non-convertible debentures, zero coupon rate and specific rate, registered and bearer debentures.

*Issue of Debenture:* Debentures are said to be issued at par when the amount to be collected on them is equal to their nominal or face value. If the issue price is more than nominal or face value, it is said to be issued at a premium. If the issue price is less than the nominal or face value, it is said to be issued on discount. The amount received as premium is credited to 'securities premium account' whereas amount of discount allowed is debited to "loss/discount on issue" and is written-off over the years

*Issue of Debentures for consideration other than Cash:* Sometimes debentures can be issued to vendor or suppliers of patents, copyrights and for transfer of intellectual property rights on preferential basis without receiving money in cash.

*Purchase Consideration:* Purchase consideration is amount paid by purchasing company in consideration for purchase of assets/business firm, another enterprise/vendor.

*Collateral Security:* Any security in addition to primary security is called 'collateral security'.

*Redemption of Debenture:* Means discharge of liability on account of debenture/bond by repayment made to debenture holders Normally, the redemption takes place on the expiry of period for which they have been issued, depending upon the terms and conditions of issue.
