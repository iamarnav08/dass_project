### **Do you know?**

A river in New Zealand has become the first in the world to be recognised as a living entity with the legal status of a person after a 170-year battle by the local Maori people.

The nation's parliament passed a bill to allow Whanganui River— known by the Maoris as Te Awa Tupua— to represent its own interests and advocate on its own behalf.

This is a unique judgement for sustaining the health and well-being of the river.

### **Reading Comprehension**

Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.

### **Text I**

When we think of tourism, we think primarily of people who are visiting a particular place for sightseeing, visiting friends and relatives, taking a vacation, and having a good time. They may spend their leisure time engaging in various sports, sunbathing, talking, singing, taking rides, touring, reading or simply enjoying further. We may include in our definition of tourism people who are participating in a convention, a business conference, or some other kind of business or professional activity. Those who are taking a study tour under an expert guide or doing some kind of scientific research or study are also doing tourism. These visitors use all forms of transportation from hiking in a wilderness park to flying in a jet to an exciting city. Transportation can include taking a chairlift up a Colorado mountainside or standing at the rail of a cruise ship looking across the blue Caribbean. Whether people travel by one of these means or by car, motor coach camper, train, motorbike or bicycle, they are taking a trip and thus are engaging in tourism.

### **Text II**

Following is an excerpt from the travelogue, *The Innocents Abroad* by Mark Twain.

A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship and went on board. All was bustle and confusion. The pier was crowded with carriages and men; passengers were arriving and hurrying on board; the vessel's decks were encumbered with trunks and valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in unattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens. The gallant flag was up, but it was under the spell, too, and hung limp and disheartened by the mast. Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest spectacle!

*pier:* a long structure built in the sea and joined to the land at one end

*woebegone:* very sad or miserable

fashion show competition, among others. As many as 85 stalls have been put up by florists, gardening equipment wholesalers and seed retailers. Entry to the show has been made free for all. However, this year, it's the pollution control plants that have been grabbing all eyeballs.

All plants emit oxygen, but it was established in a study conducted by National Aeronautics and Space Administration back in 1989 that some indoor plants could be extremely useful in controlling the air pollution by acting as a 'vacuum cleaner' against the pollutants and absorbing them.

Detox plants, which act as 'vacuum cleaners' inside the house, are a hit in the ongoing event. Nature enthusiasts are preferring them for pollution control as well as interior decoration.

#### **A Visit to Bhitarkanika**

The sun was warm but the sea breeze kept up its cooling effect all along. Soon the steamer turned away and anchored near a creek by the river. The muddy fringe and the mangrove vegetation declared the gateway to the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary in Odisha. The steamer could not negotiate these creeks at low tide, so a similar motorboat was hired to ferry us to the Dangmal forest rest-house in the heart of the mangrove forest. From the motorboat we had a good look at a large crocodile basking in the sun.

The boat moved on, taking us deeper into the forest. Here we felt as though we had stepped into a time warp. In this awesome and mysterious place, birds of extraordinary plumage appeared before us. For the moment we revelled in the magnificence of nature which had us completely in its thrall. Among the birds, the kingfishers were the stars of the show. Crocodiles, large and small, slid into the water at our approach. Through the foliage we could see chital deer delicately browsing on fresh outcrops of leaves.

A herd of wild boar was spotted searching for succulent roots. High above us, open-billed storks stood sentry-like following our progress through their remarkable kingdom. The evening sun was beginning to paint the tree-lined horizon crimson and gold and a brooding silence enveloped us all.

"Travelling––it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller."

(Ibn Batuta, a 14th century traveller) "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."

(Mark Twain, *The Innocents Abroad*)
