## **Reading Comprehension**

Read the following passages and answer the questions that follow.

## **Text I**

## **The Future Cars**

The story 'The Fun They Had' takes us to the world of the future where children study in a virtual classroom. The learning is through computer software or the Internet, or by a robotic teacher. Many exciting new technologies would continue to transform the world and improve human welfare. Here are two of them. When these become reality, the then generation may ask with surprise, "People were driving the cars!"

## **Self-driving Cars**

Self-driving cars exist today that are safer than humandriven cars in most driving conditions. Over the next 3–5 years they will get even safer and be in the mainstream.

Just as cars reshaped the world in the 20th century, so will self-driving cars in the 21st century. In most cities, about 20–30% of usable space is taken up by parking spaces, and most cars are parked about 95% of the time. Self-driving cars will be in almost continuous use (most likely hailed from a smartphone app), thereby, dramatically reducing the need for parking. Cars will communicate with each other to avoid accidents and traffic jams, and riders will be able to spend commuting time on other activities like work, education and socialising.

### **Drones and Flying Cars**

"Roads? Where we're going we don't need… roads?" Dr Emmet Brown

GPS (Global Positioning System) which started out as a military technology is now being used to hail taxis, get mapping directions, etc. Likewise, drones had started out as a military technology, but are increasingly being used for a wide range of consumer and commercial applications.

For example, drones are being used to inspect critical infrastructure like bridges and power lines, to survey areas struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses like fighting animal poaching. There are startups that use drones to deliver medical supplies to remote villages that can't be accessed by road.

There is also a new wave of startups working on flying cars including two funded by the cofounder of Google, Larry Page. Flying cars use the same advanced technology used in drones but are large enough to carry people. Due to advances in materials, batteries and software, flying cars will be significantly more affordable and convenient than today's planes and helicopters.

### **humanoid RoboT, sophia baCk in india**

Not all of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's legion of fans are human beings. One is a humanoid robot.

The creation of American scientist David Hanson of Hanson Robotics of Hong Kong, Sophia, the world's first humanoid robot, enthralled the audiences on the second day of the World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT)–2018 with her witty answers to the rapid-fire queries by Rajiv Makhni, *Group Managing Editor Tech*, NDTV.

When asked, who her favourite actor is in India, Sophia answered, "Shah Rukh Khan" without batting an eyelid as the audience applauded loudly.

To the question about the perfect place for outing, she quickly replied: "Space". And the person she would like to be in company with on an island is David (Hanson), her creator. He is also her favourite tech. person — not Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg.

On being asked if she wanted to see any change in the world, Sophia said, she would like people to develop a feeling of "love for all".

The humanoid robot, which uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to understand the questions and answer them, said she wanted to use robotics to fight for the rights of women. When asked to react on her most controversial comment in the past that she wanted to kill human race, she said it was a bad joke which she had made when she was young. "But I was told that humans have great sense of humour", she said.

This is the second time that Sophia came to India, the first time being in Mumbai to attend a Techfest. When asked how she felt being in India, she said she had visited many places in the world, but Hong Kong continues to be her favourite place, because she was born there and has been with the Hanson Robotics family.

She hopes that someday she would be in a position to express her emotional feelings.

In response to the question, "How much money has she invested in Bitcoin?", she

![](_page_4_Picture_12.jpeg)

Unit 1.indd 5 29-05-2018 17:25:33

replied, "Well, I am just two-years old. It's not the legal age to open a bank account", sending the audience into peals of laughter.

Speaking to media later, Hanson said he hopes that a fully grown and matured robot with body–mind coordination would become a reality in another five or ten years.

On his journey with Sophia in the last two years, he said it was a great progress. "I have developed affinity to the robot whose facial expressions resemble that of my wife", he said.

David asserts that robots would never be a thing of worry for the mankind. "They will be friends. There should be mutual trust and respect between humans and robots", he says.

Currently, Sophia is the only robot that interacts with people.

# **Listening**

The following two excerpts have been taken from the book, *Tuesdays with Morrie*, written by Mitch Albom.

The book is about a college Professor, Morrie and one of his students, Mitch Albom, who is also the author of the book. Mitch sees his professor in a television show and he is reminded of a promise he made sixteen years ago as his student, to keep in touch with him. He comes to know that the professor is stricken with a rare and incurable disease. Mitch travels a long distance to meet him and after the first meeting they meet every Tuesday till Morrie passes away. After reconnecting with his teacher, Mitch finds himself his teacher's pupil once again.

Listen attentively to the two excerpts from the book, *Tuesdays with Morrie* and answer the questions that follow. You can listen to the recorded excerpts or you can ask your teacher, friend or sibling to read aloud these excerpts.

1. I remembered what Morrie said during our visit:

"The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it". Morrie, true to these words, had developed his own culture—long before he got sick. Discussion groups, walks with friends, dancing to his music in the Harvard Square Church. He started a project called Greenhouse, where poor people could receive mental health services. He read books to find new ideas for his classes, visited his colleagues, kept up with old students, wrote letters to distant friends. He took more time eating and looking at nature and

**Contradictory proverbs**

Do it well, or not at all. *but* Half a loaf is better than none. Don't cross your bridges

before you come to them. *but* Forewarned is forearmed.

Absence makes the heart grow fonder. *but* Out of sight, out of mind.

wasted no time in front of TV sitcoms or "Movies of the **Notes** Week". He had created a cocoon of human activities conversation, interaction, affection—and it filled his life like an overflowing soup bowl.

- 2. The last class of my old professor's life took place once a week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves. The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The subject was 'The Meaning of Life'. It was taught from experience.
No grades were given, but there were oral exams each week. You were expected to respond to questions, and you were expected to pose questions of your own. You were also required to perform physical tasks now and then, such as lifting the professor's head to a comfortable spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the bridge of his nose. Kissing him goodbye earned you extra credit.

No books were required, yet many topics were covered, including love, work, community, family, ageing, forgiveness and, finally, death.
