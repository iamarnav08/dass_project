# **Individual Games**

Games and sports are important parts of our lives. They are essential to enjoy overall health and well-being. Sports and games offer numerous advantages and are thus highly recommended for everyone irrespective of their age. Sports with individualistic approach characterised with graceful skills of players are individual sports. Do you like the idea of playing an individual sport and be responsible for your win or loss, success or failure? There are various sports that come under this category. This chapter will help you to enhance your knowledge about Athletics, Badminton, Gymnastics, Judo, Swimming, Table Tennis, and Wrestling.

# **Athletics**

Running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. Track and field events are the improved versions of all these. These are among the oldest of all sporting competitions. Athletics consist of track and field events. In the track events, competitions of races of different distances are conducted. The different track and field events have their roots in ancient human history.

# **History**

Ancient Olympic Games are the first recorded examples of organised track and field events. In 776 B.C., in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested which was known as the stadion footrace. The scope of the games expanded in later years. Further it included running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognised today. There were five events in pentathlon namely—discus throw, long jump, javelin throw, the stadion foot race, and wrestling.

Athletics at the 1960 Summer Paralympics consisted of 25 events, 13 for men and 12 for women. Prepare the list of these events both for men and women.

Track and field events were also present at the Pan-Hellenic Games in Greece around 200 B.C. period and spread to Rome in Italy. Track and field events began developing in parts of Northern Europe in the middle ages. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were predecessor to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. Pole vault is the last track and field events which evolved in the eighteenth century.

In the late 19th century, modern track and field competitions were separated from general sporting festivals and were first recorded. These competitions were typically organised by educational institutions, military organisations, and sports clubs. Competitive hurdling first came into being, with the advent of the steeplechase in England around 1850. The first national body for the sport of athletics, The Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) was established in England in 1880. Under this grouping, track and field became the focus of the annual AAA Championships. The United States also began holding an annual national competition. The USA outdoor Track and Field Championship was held in 1868 by the New York Athletic Club.

The establishment of the modern Olympic Games at the end of the nineteenth century marked a new height for track and field events. The Olympic athletics programme comprised of track and field events including a marathon race. These also contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics.

The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades and remained most prominent among the games. The Olympics were the elite competitions for track and field, and only amateur sportsmen at that time could compete. Track and field continues to be largely an amateur sport.

The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established in 1912, becoming the international governing body for track and field.

### **Indian History of Athletics**

In the history of Indian Athletics, the decade of 1940's to 1950's is important as a number of Athletics associations were started in this decade. In 1946, the Amateur Athletics Federation of India (AAFI) was established for the management of Indian Athletics. The entire scenario of Indian Athletics was changed by AAFI as it worked in collaboration with

Chap-4.indd 50 31-07-2020 15:26:11

<sup><</sup>b>Activity 4.1

the other Athletics associations for improving sports and athletics. Indian Athletics went through many phases. Many track and field games were played in the grass.

At present synthetic track is used which has made things easier as there was no need for manual marking of tracks and associated definitions for throws and jumps in those tracks. Application of technology has helped the athletes and improved the status of the sport.

India has so far produced a number of successful athletes in the international level who have a rich tradition of winning performances in the international tournaments.

Some of the most successful athletes in the early history of Indian Athletics are Milkha Singh, T.C. Yohannan, Gurbachan Singh, Sriram Singh, etc. Some of the notable Indian Athletes in the contemporary period include P.T. Usha, Anju Bobby George, Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, Saraswati Saha, Soma Biswas, etc.

### **Classification of Athletics Events**

According to the nature of competitions, athletics events are classified into four types. These are—

> **Track Events:** All running events come under track events.

> **Field Events:** The jumping and throwing events are called field events.

> **Combined Events:** There are some other unique events which are called as combined events. These are also organised in athletics. In fact, these are the combination of some track and field events, such as decathlon, heptathlon, etc.

> **Events conducted outside the stadium:** These events are held outside the track, on roads or at natural places; for example, Marathon of 42.195 km and 20 and 50 km walk.

### *Classification of Track Events*

Track events are classified into three categories. These are—

| Table 1: Classification of Track Events |
| --- |

| 1. Short Distance | 2. Middle | 3. Long |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Races | Distance Races | Distance Races |
| 100 m | 800 m | 3000 m |
|  |  | steeplechase |

#### *Classification of Field Events*

Field events are classified into two categories—jumping events and throwing events. Further these are classified as given below:

#### **Table 2: Classification of Field Events**

| Jumping Events | Throwing Events |
| --- | --- |
| Long Jump | Shot Put |
| High Jump | Discus Throw |
| Triple Jump | Javelin Throw |
| Pole Vault | Hammer Throw |

# *Classification of Combined Events*

Combined events are those events which are characterised as mixed events from the track as well as field events. For men there are mixed events called 'Decathlon' and comprised of 10 events to be completed within the span of two days. Combined track and field events for women are called 'Heptathlon' and are divided into seven events. These mixed events are classified below.

#### **Table 3: Classification of Combined Events**

| Decathlon (Men) |  |  | Heptathlon (Women) |

#### **Do You Know?**

- **•** Sebastian Coe from Great Britain was one of the world's greatest athlete winner of four medals at Olympic Games, and had not taken a single day rest between his training.
- **•** Steeplechase—A hurdle race with water jumps came into existence in England around 1850.

#### **Activity 4.3**

Collect the information about the events under 'Decathlon' and 'Heptathlon', which are to be completed on the first day of the competition and on the second day of competition.

### **General Rules**

These are some of the general rules which need to be followed by every athlete during the events.

- **•** The athlete should run with shoes.
- **•** There should be a number on the chest and back of every athlete. No athlete can participate without the number. Only in the games of Pole Vault and High Jump, an athlete can bear one number.
- **•** If an athlete runs before the gun is fired, it is considered as a foul and is expelled from the event. Only in the combined events, the athlete is given a warning for first foul, but on the second foul, the athlete is expelled from the game.
- **•** The starter speaks in English at the time of start.
- **•** If any athlete obstructs the other athlete, then the referee can expel that athlete.
- **•** In the races up to 400 m, all the athletes have to finish them in the same lane allotted to them.
- **•** 800 m race starts in lanes but lanes are changed to first lane after the first curve.

### **Athletics Track**

A track is formed by two straight lines and two curved lines. It is oval shaped. Track surface can be of soil, grass, or synthetic. In the national and international competitions, the synthetic tracks, which are also known as all-weather tracks are used. In all races up to and including 400 m, each athlete has a separate lane, with a width of 1.22 m to 1.25 m to be marked by lines 5 cm in width.

## **Methods of starting the Race**

Each race is started with a starting gun. The main two types of start are—

> **Crouch Start:** This type of start is essential for sprint races. Starting block is used in this start, so the athlete can better use their reaction, speed, and explosive power.

- **•** Starting line in the track events is included and the Finish line is excluded. Line on the right hand side of the lane is included in the width of each lane.
- **•** No check marks are permitted in the track except for relays.

Chap-4.indd 54 31-07-2020 15:26:12

### *Types of Crouch Start*

The crouch start is further divided into three types.

#### *Bunch or Bullet Start*

In such a start, the distance from the starting line to the block is between 16 to 19 inches. The distance between both the blocks (front leg and rear leg) may be 8 to 11 inches. The athlete sets the body in crouching position in such a way that the rear toe and the heal of front foot should be in a straight line. The toes should be behind the starting line like a bridge but in the line of big toe. In the set position, the hips should be slightly lifted up and the arms should be straight. This last position in the bunch start is a little unstable which helps the athlete in leaving the block quickly.

#### *Medium Start*

The distance of the blocks from the starting line is 15 to 18 inches. The distance between both the blocks (front leg and rear leg) may be 15 to 20 inches. The knee of rear leg and the arch of front foot should be in a straight line. The shoulders and hips are almost at the same height.

#### *Elongated start*

The distance of the blocks from the starting line is 11 to 14 inches. The distance between both the blocks (front leg and rear leg) may be 25 to 29 inches. The rear knee is placed near the front heal. In the crouch start, the distance between the blocks depends upon the length of the leg, breadth of the hip, length of torso, strength of arms and time reaction, etc. Medium start is considered as better than the other two starts. Most of the athletes, therefore, use this type of start.

The distance between the blocks (front and rear leg) varies and depends on the height of the athlete.

![](_page_6_Picture_10.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.2: Types of crouch start*

#### *Starting block*

An athlete uses starting block in track events for all the sprinting ability to get a good start. The starting block helps the athlete to give support during the start of race to expel the body forward. Starting block needs to be kept in right angle according to

Chap-4.indd 55 31-07-2020 15:26:12

![](_page_7_Picture_1.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.3: Starting block*

the height of the athlete. A starting block needs to be strong and adjustable.

Before starting, the athlete should be calm and composed. The athlete should wait for the commands while standing near the assembly line.

#### *On Your Marks*

On the command 'On your marks', the athlete will move towards the starting line and will take position at the starting block. The head is kept in resting position. In this position, the hand will be placed parallel to but behind the starting line and according to the width of the shoulders. The weight of the body is distributed on the rear knee and hands. In the starting position, the shoulders can be moved ahead of starting line. The neck should be in resting position but the concentration of athlete should be towards the next command.

![](_page_7_Picture_7.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.4: Both side views of the 'on your marks' position*

#### *Set*

Athlete keeps the back a little above the shoulder. The weight of the body is equally distributed over the front foot and hands. This last position is usually unstable and tense which helps in leaving the block easily. Head should be in resting position and the grip on the block should be strong. The athlete should be alert enough to listen to the next command.

![](_page_7_Picture_11.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.5: 'Set' position*

#### *Gun shot*

Soon after the gun shot, the athlete has to leave the block as quickly as possible. This helps in a good start. The athlete should lift his body gradually after taking a start.

### *Types of Finishing*

The finishing of all the races is very important. A little difference can alter the athlete's ranking. The following techniques during training process need to be learned to finish the race.

#### *Lunging forward*

In this technique, the athlete lunges the body forward just before the finishing line. The athlete needs to spread arms backward in order to expand the chest forward. While spreading his arms the athlete needs to balance his body.

#### *Shoulder shrug*

In this technique, the athlete needs to bend shoulders towards the finishing line. The body weight is carried forward while maintaining the balance of the body. While shrugging the shoulders, the athlete needs to bend his head as well as upper body towards the finishing line.

### *Run through*

This technique is usually adopted by new athletes. The athlete runs through the finishing line after completing the race. The athlete should not reduce the pace before finishing.

![](_page_8_Picture_11.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.6: Techniques of finishing the race*

### **Relay Races**

Relay races are team events. In this race, four runners complete a given distance. Each relay team needs four runners. Each runner runs the quarter of the running track, while holding

#### **Do You Know?**

Steeple chase—A hurdle race with water jumps came into existence in England around 1850.

a baton. Two runners will exchange the baton only in a given exchange zone mark in track. If the baton falls in the exchange zone, then only the athlete who has dropped it will lift it.

#### **Table 4: Types of Relay Races**

| Relay Races for Men and Women |
| --- |
| 4×100 meter |
| 4×400 meter |
| Members of Relay team = 6 |
| Running members = 4 |
| Length of Baton 28–30 cm |
| Circumference of Baton 12–13 cm |
| Weight of Baton at least 50 gms |
| Baton exchange zone 20 m |
| Acceleration zone 10 m |

#### *Methods of baton exchange*

*Downward pass*

There are three methods of baton exchange, which are—

*Fig. 4.7: Method to give the baton from the bottom*

In such a pass, the runner who is to run will move his hand back to take the baton with palms facing upwards. The thumbs will be towards the inner side and the palm will be upward. The athlete holding the baton, will hold the baton from one end and will place the other end of the baton in the

Chap-4.indd 58 31-07-2020 15:26:14

hands of the athlete who is about to run.

#### *Upward pass*

In such a pass, the athlete who is going to hold the baton will keep the hand in a 'V' shape, which will be used to take the baton near the hip, upside down. The athlete who is passing the baton will hold the baton in such a way, that it will get nearer to the other athlete. This pass is easier for the new runner.

![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.8: Method to give the baton from the upper side*

#### *Push pass*

Push pass is exactly similar to the downward pass at the change over box. The athlete, who is holding the baton, runs while aiming at the elbow of the other athlete with the baton. The other athlete takes the baton with his arm moving backward.

#### **Jumping Events**

Jumping Events consist of four events. However, only two (Long jump and High jump) are discussed below.

- **•** Long Jump
- **•** High Jump
- **•** Triple Jump
- **•** Pole Vault

#### *Long Jump*

Long jump is considered as the main field event. In this event, the athlete has to jump from the takeoff board to the jumping pit. The entire group of athletes will get three jumps to qualify for the final phase of the competition. Athletes should have speed, power and flexibility for it. Eight qualified jumpers are selected for the final phase of the competition. Three more chances are given to the selected eight jumpers for getting final ranking.

#### **Table 5: Information about Long Jump**

# *Methods of Long Jump*

Athletes usually use the following methods for long jump—

- 1. Sail Technique
- 2. Hang Technique
- 3. Hitch-kick Technique

### *Phases of Long Jump*

There are the four phases in long jump.

**Runway:** The athlete attains his maximum speed by running on the runway so that he can reach the take off board with full speed and also to get the maximum momentum.

![](_page_12_Picture_9.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.11: The hang technique*

**Take-off:** The athlete takes-off with his strong foot by pushing it against the take-off board. The athlete raises both the hands up and as a result his entire body is raised up. The front leg is lifted upwards and the knee is bent.

**Flight:** When the body of the athlete is in the air after the take-off, it is known as flight. During flight position, the athlete uses various techniques like hang method or hitch-kick technique. The momentum gained during the runway helps the body to move forward in the air.

**Landing:** Both feet of the athlete simultaneously touch the ground while landing. During landing, the legs should be kept straight. Both hands should be raised and taken towards the feet and the neck should be bent forward. This posture helps in gaining some more distance in the air and the body gets balanced while landing.

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.12: Hitch-kick technique*

#### *High Jump*

This is also one of the major field events. In this, the athlete crosses the crossbar with a jump. Activeness and flexibility are important for the athlete.

#### **Table 6: Information about High Jump**

| Minimum length of runway | 15 m |
| --- | --- |
| Size of landing area | 6 m×4 m |
| Height of landing pit | 0.60 m – 0.70 m |
| Distance between two poles | 4.00 m – 4.04 m |
| Length of crossbar | 4.00 m (±2cm) |
| Weight of crossbar | 2 kg |
| Diameter of crossbar | 29 mm – 31 mm |
| Length of rectangular edges of crossbar | 15 cm – 20 cm |
| Width of edges of crossbar | 30 mm – 35 mm |
| Gap between the edges of crossbar and | 10 mm |
| poles |  |

#### *Techniques of High Jump*

The most popular technique of high jump is Fosbury Flop. However some other techniques are also used. Which are—

> **Scissor Jump:** To jump over the crossbar with alternate legs and to land on the feet is called scissor jump.

> **Western roll :** Rolling over the crossbar and landing on the back is known as western roll.

![](_page_13_Figure_11.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 62 31-07-2020 15:26:16

**Straddle Technique:** In this technique, the legs are taken alternately over the crossbar and the body is rolled near the bar.

**Fosbury Flop:** It is a new technique. In this, the bar is crossed by back after bending the body. The landing is done on the shoulders.

![](_page_14_Picture_3.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.13: Fosbury flop*

# *General Rules*

Certain general rules of high jump are given below.

- **•** Jumper needs—to jump on one foot only.
- **•** It will be a foul, if an athlete—
	- **▪** shakes the bar from the support.
	- **▪** touches the ground with any part of his body before clearing the poles.
- **•** An athlete can jump from any height. Consecutive three failures from a particular height will disqualify the athlete.
- **•** Poles should not be moved during the competition.
- **•** If there are more than three athletes, the time fixed for each jump is one minute. If two to three athletes are there in the competition, time of 1.30 minutes is given. Whereas a time of 3 minutes is given to a single athlete.

![](_page_14_Picture_14.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 63 31-07-2020 15:26:17

- **•** Athlete can mark the runway according to the wish, but can use only the adhesive tape given by the organisers.

### **Throwing Events**

The following four events are not included in the throwing events, but only two (Shot put and Discus) are explained in this book.

- **•** Shot put
- **•** Discus

Shot put is one of the main throwing events. The athlete who throws the shot is called as shot putter. The athlete should have qualities like power, flexibility and speed to throw the shot.

### *Methods of Shot put*

The following are the methods of shot put.

### **1. Gliding Technique**

- a) Grip: The shot is held at the base of the fingers, not the palm. Fingers are slightly spread apart with the thumb for support. The hand will be bent back in a cocked position when holding the shot.
- b) Shot placement: The shot is placed below the ear. It needs to be placed near the jaw bone and over the collar bone.
- c) Standing Position: The shot putter places the right foot on the half way circle line and the left foot along the back line (towards the direction of throw) of the circle.
- d) Gliding Phase: Keep the right foot exactly straight and the toe of the left foot touching on the ground just in front of the stop board. The left foot will rapidly move forward while bending at the knee to take thrust from the hip joint. The right foot will be dragged from the ground.
- e) Final Phase: The last phase of the putting shot will be associated with the turn of body and changing of rear left foot to right for balancing the body weight. The hips will be carried forward. This turn is most vital for the shot putter as it has to be combined with the throwing of arms to put the shot for distance. The whole body weight will be maintained on right foot after the release of shot.

*Fig. 4.16: Gliding technique for throwing shot*

#### **2. Rotation Technique for Throwing Shot**

- a) Initial Position: In the initial position, the athlete will stand with the back towards the direction of putting the shot. The left foot will be on central line and the right foot will be just behind. The right foot will be 5–8 cm behind the iron rim to avoid foul during rotation of the body.
- b) Rotation: The weight of the body will be on the right foot. Rotation will start after taking just one swing from the starting position. In this position, the left arm will be kept parallel to the ground on left side.

Chap-4.indd 66 31-07-2020 15:26:20

The right foot will be brought over the left foot while leaning the shoulder when the shot reaches the middle. Both the shoulders will rotate after leaning and laying the entire body weight on the toes. The shoulder and the trunk will fully rotate towards the right and the body weight will also shift on the left foot.

### *Discus Throw*

Discus throw is an old and popular event. The athlete should have power, elasticity, speed and balance for discus throw.

#### **Table 8: Information about Discus Throw**

| Weight of discus | 2 kg (men), 1 kg (women) |
| --- | --- |
| Diameter of discus | 219 mm – 221 mm (men) |
|  | 180 mm – 182 mm (women) |

#### **Do You Know?**

The first national body of athletics 'Amateur Athletic Association, (AAA), was established in England.

#### *Initial Stage of Discus Throw*

At First the athlete will stand in the circle near the ring with the back against the direction of throwing the discus. The athlete will take one or two swings while rotating the right arm along with the body. In this position, the whole body weight will shift from one foot to another. The heels will lift upward. The upper part of the body should be bent towards right side, while the discus is on the right side. The circle will start from the lower part of the body, the left foot will be rotated leftward, and the body weight will rest on it. The right knee and right foot will also rotate.

In this position, the process of crossing the discus will start. First of all, the left foot will leave the ground. After this, the left foot will take the position of throwing the discus. The right foot (bent at knee) will rotate from left to right in a semi-circle. Both the muscles will be in front of the shoulder while rotating and as a result, there will be a bend in the upper and lower portion of the body.

# **Judo**

# **History**

Judo is considered to have originated from Japan. Jigoro Kano invented this game in 1882, and he is considered as the founder father of Judo. It is believed that Judo is the comprehensive form of another ancient self-defence form 'Ju Jutsu'. Judo is an art of self-defence and is considered gentle a way of attack with the help of one's own body. Judo is an ideal form of physical exercise and self-defence. Judo became a system of self-defence in Japan involving throwing, hitting, kicking, choking, bending and pinning an opponent. Jigoro Kano reviewed all the principles of attack and defence and correctly applied these to the game. Judo in male category was introduced in Tokyo Olympic Games in 1964. Judo in women category was added in the Barcelona Olympic, 1992.

# **Emergence of Judo in India**

Judo was introduced through the Judo training centre at Visva Bharati University started by Rabindranath Tagore in 1905. It is believed that on the suggestion of Okakura Kakuzo (master of Judo in Japan), Rabindranath Tagore called a Judo expert from Japan to India in 1905.

Judo Federation of India (JFI) was formed in India in 1965 and thus attained steady growth. Worldwide, Judo is governed

#### **Do You Know?**

- **•** The word judo is literally explained by 'Ju' which means gentle and 'Do' that means path. Thus this game is considered as a gentle path of selfdefense.
- **•** Judo was first officially taught at the Kōdōkan Judo Institute in Japan in 1882.

Chap-4.indd 88 31-07-2020 15:26:33

by the IJF (International Judo Federation). The year 1966 witnessed the first National Judo Championship in Hyderabad.

Judo was included in the Asian Games in 1986 at Seoul and India got its much needed break in Seoul Asian Games, where Indians bagged four bronze medals. It was a milestone for team India and since then, India has been performing continuously at international Judo events. Several Indian *Judoka* (a person who practises or is an expert in Judo) qualified for the Olympic Games. Several of them received the prestigious Arjuna Award for their performances. In the 2010 Judo World Cup in Tashkent, Thoudam Kalpana Devi of Manipur became the first Indian to be included among the top-three positions in the World Cup.

### **Basic Techniques**

A few basic techniques of Judo given below with the original terminology and their English version.

- 1. *Tachi-Waza*—Standing techniques
- 2. *Koshi-Waza*—Hip techniques
- 3. *Ashi-Waza*—Leg techniques
- 4. *Te-Waza*—Hand techniques
- 5. *Osae-komi*-*Waza*—Ground techniques (Holds)
- 6. *Kensetsu-Waza*—Arm lock techniques
- 7. *Shime-Waza*—Choking techniques

### **Basic rules**

- (i) During international competitions, each match lasts for four minutes, and points and penalties are awarded by the match referee assisted by the judges.
- (ii) The main objective of the player is to score an 'Ippon' (winning point) before the time runs out. Once a player scores an *Ippon* or is given a 'Hansoku-make' (severe penalty), the match ends immediately. Otherwise, the winner of the match is determined by the scored points.
- (iii) If the points are equal, then the winner is declared on the basis of the least number of penalty points known as 'Shido', means minor penalties.
- (iv) *Judoka* are not allowed to employ any of the outlawed techniques, attacking joints other than the elbows, punching or kicking, touching the opponent's face, or intentionally injuring the opponent in any way.
- (v) In a judo bout, *Judoka* can achieve two types of scores (*Ippon* and *waza-ari*).

Chap-4.indd 89 31-07-2020 15:26:34

#### **Do You Know?**

- **•** Yasuhiro Yamashita is a legend of world Judo.
- **•** Judogi is the formal Japanese name for the traditional uniform used for Judo practice and competition.
- (vi) *Ippon* is the best, as it results in immediate victory. *Ippon* can be achieved by throwing an opponent in such a way as to make them land on their back.
- (vii) *Ippon* can also be achieved by trapping an opponent in an armhold or stranglehold to the extent that it forces the opponent to surrender or immobilising an opponent on the floor for at least 20 seconds.
- (viii) The next best score is *waza-ari*, which is awarded for lesser throws than those required for scoring ippon, and for immobilising the opponent for less than the time required to score *ippon*, i.e., 10 seconds.
- (ix) There are two types of penalties awarded in judo—*shido*  and *hansoku-make*. Awarding *hansoku-make* to a judoka automatically gives the match to the opponent. *Hansoku-make* is given for major rule breaches or for the accumulation of three *shidos*. The third *shido*  becomes *hansoku-make* (disqualified).

# **Golden Score**

In case there is no score(s) or scores are equal, the contest will continue till golden score. Any score or penalties from regular time will remain on the scoreboard and will be extended into the golden score overtime period. The decision in the golden score is made by the deference or score or hansoku-make.

# **Measurements of Contest Area in Judo**

A traditional Judo match takes place on *tatami* mats measuring 14×14 meters or 16×16 meters, with a combat area of 9×9 meters or 10×10 meters marked out within it. Players must wear the designated uniform with an appropriate knotted belt. The Judo player/athletes who are called Judoka, must bow before stepping onto the mat, and must bow to each other before and after the competition.

# **Competition area**

The competition area is a minimum of 14m×14m and is divided into two zones. The inner zone called the contest area is a minimum of 8m×8m to a maximum of 10m×10m. The outer zone is the safety area and is a minimum of 3m wide. The contesting area is of different colour to the safety area.

When using two or more adjoining competition areas, the common or shared safety area is 4m. A free zone, a minimum of 50 cm, must be maintained around the entire competition area.

#### **Do You Know?** In the 1912 Olympic games, Fanny Durack of Australia became the first Female Olympic Swimming Gold Medalist in 100 m Free Style.

# **Swimming**

#### **History**

In the early 1800s, swimming emerged as a competitive sport in England. The first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths, was opened for public use in the year 1828. The first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association, was formed in the year 1880.

The Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens, which was a male-only competition. Six events were planned for the swimming competition, but only four events were actually contested—100 m, 500 m, and 1200 m freestyle and 100 m for sailors. The first gold medal was won by Alfréd Hajós of Hungary in the 100 m freestyle.

In 1908, the world swimming body 'Federation Internationale de Natation' (FINA) was formed.

Women were first allowed to take part in swimming competitions in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm competing in freestyle races. In the 1912 games, Harry Hebner of the United States won the 100 m backstroke.

### **History of Swimming in India**

In the year 1948, the Swimming Federation of India (SFI) was formed. Since then this body is looking after the promotion and administration of aquatic sports in India. The SFI is affiliated to FINA, the world governing body for the sport.

Few not able Indian swimmers are Sachin Nag, Sufyan Shaikh, Khajan Singh, Nisha Milled, Sikha Tandon, and Sandeep Sejwal.

**Activity 4.9**

Make a list of the Olympic events of swimming.

away from the water for a good amount of years. So, how you teach swimming is very important. If swimming is not taught properly and correctly, children can develop a phobia.

#### *Role of the Teacher*

- 1. Cheerful attitude
- 2. Understand individual differences
- 3. Offer plenty of encouragement
- 4. Recognise the fear of the student
- 5. Develop self-confidence in students
- 6. Praise students
- 7. Have patience

#### *The beginning*

Assemble the class at pool side at a given point of time. First, orient the children with pool surroundings and swimming environment by taking them around the pool, showing various equipment, changing rooms, different depths of the pool, specially the limits of shallow water. Also brief the safety, health and hygiene rules which are to be followed by all at the pool. Engage them in talks and bring them closer to the pool. Make them sit on the deck around the shallow end with feet hanging and swinging in the water, making waves. Also encourage them to lean forward and touch the water with hands.

#### *Entry into the pool*

Organise a partner system (spotter system), one acting as a spotter for the other. If required, air tubes and arm bands may be used. Various methods of safe entry may be used, i.e., walking down the steps if provided at the shallow end facing the pool side, sit on the pool side, grip the railing with the other hand, try the same method by facing pool side and jump towards the teacher/partner already into the water to support.

#### *Movement at the shallow end*

Encourage the children to move along the wall, rail or scum gutter immediately on entering the water. Take support with one hand and paddle with the support of rail or wall and paddle with both hands while walking at the shallow end. Later, introduce hopping and let them sink down up to shoulder level.

Breathing with the mouth may be introduced by blowing into the water taken in both hands or by putting the face on the surface in standing position with feet apart.

![](_page_47_Picture_19.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 96 31-07-2020 15:26:36

#### *Getting the feet off the bottom*

Walking across the pool with shoulders submerged and arms at stretch for support and holding kick boards with both hands. Gradually increase the speed and lean forward until the feet rise from the bottom. Students stand back towards the wall in forward leaning position, approximately 2 meters away, arms stretched forward on the surface and shoulder submerged. From this position, they lean forward on the water, push off with the feet and glide towards a wall, rail or scum gutter.

#### *Floating*

Remember that it is much easier to float on the surface by keeping the body relaxed than by thrashing about with arms and legs. After having left the bottom with support, the child should now be ready to float without any support or help.

#### *Types of Floats*

There are many techniques of floating, such as—

- 1. Tuck float
- 2. Jellyfish float
- 3. Prone float
- 4. Star float
- 5. Supine float

#### *Pushing off, gliding and standing up again*

The beginners should now gain confidence, as swimming is based on the principle of gliding across the surface of the water. Stand with your back to the side walls of the pool and close up against it, leave the shoulders into the water keeping the head above the surface, now place the foot against the wall, take a deep breath, lower the face into the water and kick the wall with the raised foot.

Lift the other leg so that both the legs end up straight and pointed behind. The body will stretch on the surface and now glide towards the partner who is standing 4–5 meters away. The partner now holds the out stretched hand, lowers the hips, pulls the knees under the body, thrust them down to the bottom placing a little apart, and the beginner stands up on the floor raising the head and shoulders.

Practice gliding further with a float held in extended hands. It enables the beginner to stay on the surface and make him ready to learn the stroke.

#### *Which Stroke First?*

There are no set rules regarding the order in which swimming strokes should be taught to the beginners. There are various

![](_page_48_Picture_18.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 97 31-07-2020 15:26:36

schools of thought about the stroke best suited to the beginners. Some suggest back stroke for beginners.

Whatever the merits of any stroke may be, a multiple stroke approach in the early stages may be preferred whereby the learner is given an experience of all the strokes and later the learner allowed to make up one's own mind. The butterfly stroke, however, may be introduced at a later stage as it requires a high degree of swimming proficiency, strength and co-ordination.

### **Fundamental rules and regulations**

Following rules should be followed by the competitors while swimming in a race.

- (i) A swimmer shall swim the course alone and cover the whole distance to qualify.
- (ii) A swimmer must finish the race in the same lane in which he started.
- (iii) In all the events, a swimmer while turning, shall make physical contact with the end of the pool. The turn must be made from the wall, and it is not permissible to take a stride or step from the bottom of the pool.
- (iv) Standing on the bottom during freestyle events or during the freestyle portion of medley events shall not disqualify a swimmer, but he shall not walk.
- (v) Pulling on the lane rope is not allowed.
- (vi) Obstructing another swimmer by swimming across another lane or interfering the other shall disqualify the offender. Should the foul be intentional, the referee shall report the matter to the member promoting the race and to the swimmer so offending.
- (vii) No swimmer shall be permitted to use or wear any device that may aid speed, buoyancy or endurance during a competition (webbed gloves, fins, etc.). Goggles may be worn.
- (viii) Any swimmer not participating in a race shall be disqualified, if they enter the water, in which an event is being conducted before the preceding team-mate touches the wall.
- (ix) There shall be four swimmers in each relay team.
- (x) In relay events, the team of swimmers whose feet lose touch with the starting platform before the preceding team-mate touches the wall, shall be disqualified.
- (xi) Any relay team shall be disqualified from a race if a team member, other than the swimmer supposed to

![](_page_49_Figure_16.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 98 31-07-2020 15:26:36

swim that length, enters the water when the race is being conducted, before swimmers of all the teams have finished the race being conducted.

- (xii) The member of a relay team and their order of competing must be nominated before the race. Any relay team member may compete in the race only once.
 The composition of a relay team may be changed between the heats and finals of the event, provided that it is made up from the list of swimmers properly entered by a member of that event. Failure to swim in the order listed, will result in disqualification. Substitutions may be made only in the case of a documented medical emergency.

- (xiii) Any swimmer having finished his race, or his distance in a relay event, must leave the pool as soon as possible without obstructing any other swimmer who has not yet finished his race. Otherwise the swimmer committing the fault or his relay team shall be disqualified.
- (xiv) Should a foul endanger the chances of success of a swimmer, the referees shall have the power to allow him to compete in the next heat or, should the foul occur in a final event or in the last heat, he/she may order it to re-swim.
- (xv) No pace-making shall be permitted, nor may any device be used which has that effect.

### **Swimwear**

The swimwear includes swimsuit, cap and goggles, which shall be in good moral state and suitable for the individual sports disciplines and should not carry any symbol which may be considered offensive. The swimsuits shall be nontransparent. It is permissible to wear two caps.

### **Fundamental Techniques**

Techniques in swimming are classified into three main categories—

- 1. Strokes
- 2. Starts
- 3. Turn

### **Strokes**

In swimming, there are four strokes used in the competition all over the world.

- 1. Front Crawl or Freestyle
- 2. Back Crawl
- 3. Breast
- 4. Butterfly

*Teaching stages of front crawl stroke*

![](_page_51_Figure_14.jpeg)

![](_page_51_Figure_15.jpeg)

- **1. Body Position:** The basic body position for teaching the front crawl stroke is streamlined prone position. The swimmer lies flat on his stomach with both arms stretched out in front, passing by the side of ears and the water level is at hair line. Both legs are extended to the back with toes pointed.
- **2. Arm Action:** The arms are pulled alternately from front to back inside the above. While one arm is pulling/pushing, the other arm is recovering. The

![](_page_51_Figure_18.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 100 31-07-2020 15:26:36

arm strokes provide most of the forward propulsion. The arm action is further divided into entry, catch, pull, push, release, initial and final recovery.

- **3. Leg Action:** The leg movements in front crawl is called the flutter kick. The legs move alternatively up and down. The leg movement originates from the hip joint. While one leg kicks downward, the other leg recovers upward. The knees are flexed with toes pointed during the downbeat and are kept straight with toes relaxed during the upbeat. Though, the leg action provides only a small amount of forward propulsion when combined with arm action, but it is essential to attain horizontal body position and reduce the body drag.
- **4. Lateral Breathing:** Breathing in the front crawl stroke is done on the side, whichever side is convenient to the swimmer. The swimmer takes the breath through the mouth by turning the head to the side of the pushing arm, at the beginning of recovery. Soon the face goes back into the water and the swimmer breathes out more through the mouth and only a small portion through the nose. The mouth goes to the other side also while breathing out but does not come out of the water. The swimmer continues exhalation and goes back to the same side to inhale again. Usually the swimmers take breath every arm cycle.
- **5. Body Roll:** The body of the front crawl stroke swimmer rotates around its long axis with every arm stroke so that the shoulder of the recovering arm is higher than the shoulder of the pulling/pushing arm. This helps the pulling arm to sink down and perform a deeper pull, and on the other hand, it facilitates a high elbow of the other arm.

![](_page_52_Picture_5.jpeg)

*Teaching stages of back crawl stroke*

*Fig. 4.43: Back crawl stroke*

![](_page_52_Picture_8.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 101 31-07-2020 15:26:36

- **1. Body Position:** The basic body position for teaching the back crawl stroke is streamlined supine position. The swimmer lies flat on his back with both arms stretched back over head, passing by the side of ears. Face is out of the water and both legs are extended back with toes pointed. Hips are just below the water surface.
- **2. Arm Action:** The arms are pulled alternately from back to front inside the water and recovers above the water with straight arm over the body. While one arm is pulling/pushing, the other arm is recovering. The arm strokes provide most of the forward propulsion. The arm action is further divided into various parts, such as, the entry, catch, pull, push, release, and recovery.
- **3. Leg Action:** The legs move alternately up and down. The leg movement originates from the hip joint. While one leg kicks downward, the other leg recovers upward. The knees are flexed with toes pointed during the upbeat and are kept straight with toes relaxed during the downbeat.
- **4. Lateral Breathing:** Breathing in backstroke is very easy, as the mouth and nose are usually above the water. The swimmer breathes once in every arm cycle.

*Teaching stages of breast stroke*

![](_page_53_Picture_6.jpeg)

*Fig. 4.44: Breast stroke*

- 1. Practise the kick and its movements on dry land of the water.
- 2. Practise the kick on the edge of the swimming pool in the water.
- 3. Kick back with a board held to the chest in prone position. Try to keep the knees stable at the surface and draw both the feet to the buttocks by bending at the

Chap-4.indd 102 31-07-2020 15:26:37

knee, not at the hip. Allow the swimmer to let their feet work in a wide arc, if necessary, as the main aim is to get their feet turned out. Once the swimmer has their feet ready to kick back, it is advisable to get them to pause at this point and consciously turn their feet out before kicking back, and pause again while the legs are fully extended.

- 4. Kick on front, holding the board on the back and with thumbs underneath and arms fully extended. Place the face in water and proceed to do three kicks and then breathe. Stretch and glide after each kick. Keep the head very stable with the eyes looking to the front at all times. Rocking movements of the head are best avoided as they affect the body position and the swimmer can lose track of where their arms and legs are. A stable head helps maintain a reference point. The breathing is performed by raising and lowering the head as one unit.
- 5. Repeat Step 4 by doing two kicks and one round of breathing.
- 6. One breath and one kick. Holding the board (as above) with eyes looking directly ahead and arms and legs fully extended. Ask the swimmer to lift their head and shoulders (by contracting their back muscles), then lift their feet, lower their head and shoulder, then kick and glide. Repeat this sequence over and over—stressing to the swimmer that the first movement in the sequence is raising of the head and shoulders.
	- **a. The Pull:** Swimmers have a lot of difficulty with learning the pull because they achieve very little propulsion. This causes difficulty in teaching the stroke as the swimmers modify the pull incorrectly, in order to gain propulsion. To avoid this temptation, the use of fins is employed to enable them to propel themselves while they develop the correct stroke mechanics. As the swimmers become more proficient, the fins are removed.
	- **b. The Complete Stroke:** By following the above progression, the swimmer has learned to kick and breathe, and pull and breathe with the correct timing. All that remains to do now is, to connect the two skills together and the timing should look after itself – as it has already been taught.

![](_page_54_Picture_7.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 103 31-07-2020 15:26:37

- (i) Three kicks with arms extended and one pull. Breathe only on the full stroke. Glide after each kick and look straight ahead at all times.
- (ii) Two kicks with arms extended and one pull. Breathe only on the full stroke. Glide after each kick.
- (iii) Normal breast stroke with a long glide beginning the next stroke after exhalation has been completed. The above three skills are important for consolidating the stroke. Try to develop power in the pull and the kick whilst still holding a glide in the stroke. By doing this, you will develop speed and strength without running the risk of losing the timing. Only when the swimmer is swimming strongly and correctly, should the glide be reduced for faster swimming. Fast breast stroke swimming is achieved with minimum glide but with the maintenance of maximum arm and leg extension. Teaching breast stroke is an exercise of patience but if you follow the process outlined above, you will find it as an effective way for teaching breast stroke with good technique from the earliest stages.

<sup><</sup>i>Fig. 4.45: Butterfly stroke

- **1. Body Position:** The body must be horizontal and streamlined. The teacher/coach must make sure that the swimmer can push off the wall in a streamlined position initially on the surface and progress to dropping down under the water and pushing off under water while maintaining a streamlined body position. This takes time and must be worked on continually. Apart from teaching the swimmer the position needed for their body, it also
Chap-4.indd 104 31-07-2020 15:26:38

develops the leg muscles needed for the push off in their turns and eventually the leg drive needed for their dives. Body should be either in the prone position. Legs together, toes pointed, arms extended in front of the shoulders, head positioned between the arms, ears squashed between the arms, and one hand on top of the other. There should be no gap between the arms and the ears. The top hand must be locked over the bottom hand with, no gaps.

- **2. Dolphin Kick:** The swimmers lie on the tummy, in a streamlined position and push the chest down into the water and let their bottoms rise and then vice versa, i.e., chest up and bottoms down. They can do this with the hands by the side, to begin. They continue the movement, trying to get to the other side of the pool. They must do 3–4 movements without breathing and push the chin forwards to grab a quick breath and then the head returns to the streamlined position with the eyes looking towards the bottom. Once this has been established, try to extend the arms in front of the head in the streamlined position and perform the same movement while breathing at every fourth kick. Slowly build up the strength in the kick by doing short distances with short to moderate rest intervals. The goal is for a quick movement from the legs and this takes strength and practice. Goal should be to execute three kicks per second. All kicking practices can be done with and without fins.
#### *Starts*

All four competitive strokes are to be started in the competition by using a pair of techniques known as the start. The swimmer emphasises on the quickest technique which allows him a stinger push off from the starting position. The popular starting techniques are—

- 1. Grab start
- 2. Circular start
- 3. Racing start
- 4. Conventional start
- 5. Track start

#### *Teaching Stages of Start*

For teaching the 'start' to the beginners, the following sequence is followed—

- 1. Position on the block
- 2. Take off

![](_page_56_Picture_14.jpeg)

Chap-4.indd 105 31-07-2020 15:26:38

- 3. Flight (position in the air)
- 4. Entry into the water (glide first stroke)

However, back stroke uses almost a uniform technique, which does not have any special name and is known as backstroke start.

### *Turns*

During the race, the swimmer must take a turn from the end of the wall to complete the full distance of the race. The swimmers try to use such techniques which are quicker and gives strong push off from the wall within the permissible rules of the stroke. The various turns used by the swimmers are:

- 1. Simple
- 2. Throw away
- 3. Summersault
- 4. Flip
- 5. Roll over
- 6. Breast stroke
- 7. Butterfly

*Teaching Stages of Turn*

- 1. Approach to the wall
- 2. Turn or touch
- 3. Push off
- 4. Glide First

# **Wrestling**

## **History**

Wrestling has a prominent place in the Olympic Games and considered as one of the oldest forms of combat. It is believed that pictures of combating sports like wrestling were depicted in 15,000-year-old cave drawings found in France. Early Egyptians and Babylonians were also believed to be using the same techniques for the purpose of exhibiting their superiority over others. Wrestling was also very popular in Greece. It was developed by ancient Greeks as a way to train soldiers in hand-to-hand combat and military exercises. As per records found in the history of wrestling, it was year 1888 when the first national wrestling tournament was hosted at New York City. During the first Olympic Games, only one event in free style wrestling was introduced. It was until Saint Louis Olympic Games in 1904, where the free style wrestling competition was hosted in five categories. In 1908 Olympic Games, Greco Roman wrestling was also introduced in five weight categories but the number was increased up to eleven categories in later years. The International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA) was founded in the year 1912 at Antwerp, Belgium. Norway hosted the first world women's wrestling championship in the year1987 and women wrestling was included in the Olympic Games 2004.
