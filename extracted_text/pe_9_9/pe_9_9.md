# **9.1 Introduction**

Development of personality is an important issue. Personality starts developing since birth, but it assumes great importance during adolescence, when reorganisation of personality takes place.

Personality is a very common term which is used in our day-to-day life. It tells us what type of person one is. We know that each person generally behaves consistently in most of the situations. The examples of this consistency can be seen in a person who remains friendly or a person who is generally kind or helpful in most situations. Such a consistent pattern of behaviour is termed as personality. It can be called as the sum total of behaviour that includes attitudes, emotions, thoughts, habits and traits. This pattern of behaviour is characteristic to an individual.

There are various dimensions of personality. These dimensions are related to physical, emotional, intellectual, social and spiritual aspects of our behaviour. For a holistic personality development, yoga plays an important role.

### **9.2 Yoga and Personality Development**

Yogic practices are found effective for development of all dimensions of personality.

Let us talk about the yogic practices that influences development of different dimensions of personality.

**Yoga and Physical Dimension of Personality:** Physical dimension is related to our body. It means that all organs and systems of our body should be properly developed and function. It implies a healthy body without any disease. Yogic practices like *asana*, *pranayama*, and *bandha* play a beneficial role in physical development of children. There is a series of *asanas*  and *pranayamas* which help to improve the functioning of the body.

**Yoga and Emotional Dimension of Personality:** Yogic practices are effective for development of emotional dimension related to our feelings, attitudes and emotions. There are two kinds of emotions : positive and negative. For example love, kindness are positive emotions, while anger and fear (exam phobia) are

![](_page_0_Picture_10.jpeg)

negative emotions. Similarly, our feelings and attitudes may be positive and negative. For emotional development, positive feelings, attitudes and emotions should be developed and negative ones should be controlled, as the negative attitudes and emotions work as a mental block for the development of personality. Yoga plays a critical role in development of positive emotions. It brings emotional stability. It helps to control negative emotions. Yogic practices such as *yama*, *niyama*, *asana, pranayama, pratyahara* and meditation help in emotional management. For example, the principle of non-violence will protect us from negative emotions and develop positive feelings of love and kindness. Similarly, other principles of *yama* and *niyama* will help to develop positive emotions and attitudes in our personal and social life and therefore help in the management of emotions.

**Yoga and Intellectual Dimension of Personality:** Intellectual development is related to the development of our mental abilities and processes such as critical thinking, memory, perception, decision making, imagination, creativity, etc. Development of this dimension is very important as it enables us to learn new things and acquire knowledge and skills. Yogic practices such as *asana, pranayama, dharana, dhyana* (meditation) help to develop concentration, memory and thereby help in intellectual development.

**Yoga and Social Dimension of Personality:** Primary socialisation, probably the most important aspect of the personality development takes place during infancy, usually within the family. By responding to the approval and disapproval of parents and grandparents and imitating their examples, the child learns the language and many of the basic behaviour patterns of her/his society. The process of socialisation is not limited to childhood, but continues throughout life and teach the growing child and adolescent about the norms and rules of the society in which she/he lives . Some key elements of this process include respect for others, listening carefully to other persons, being interested in them, and voicing your thoughts and feelings politely, honestly and clearly so that you can be easily heard and understood. Principles of *yama* include these key elements and are very important as these help us in the betterment of our relationships with our friends, parents, teachers and others.

**Yoga and Spiritual Dimension of Personality:** This dimension is related to the development of values. It is also concerned with self-actualisation which is related to recognising one's potential and developing them to the maximum. Proper

Chapter-9 Yoga.indd 120 08-11-2016 11:41:56 AM

development of this dimension helps the person to realise one's true identity. For spiritual development, *yama, niyama, pratyahara* and *dhyana* (meditation) are helpful. *Yama* and *niyama* help to develop our moral values while *pranayama*, and meditation help us to realise our true self. Introspection is very effective for the development of 'self'.

#### *Yama* **(Restraint) and** *Niyama* **(Observance)**

*Yama* and *Niyama* are principles which need to be adopted always in our day-to-day life. These can be considered as the universal codes of conduct that help us in following high standards in our personal and social life. Principles of *yama*  are concerned with one's social life; while the principles of *niyama* are concerned with one's personal life. *Yama* and *niyama* are part of *Ashtanga yoga*.

The five principles of *yama* are: *Ahimsa* (non-violence), *Satya* (truthfulness); *Asteya* (non-stealing); *Brahmcharya* (abstinence) and *Aparigraha* (non-collectiveness).

The five principles of *niyama* are: *Shaucha* (cleanliness); *Santosha* (satisfaction); *Tapas* (austerity); *Swadhyaya*  (study of good literature and knowing about the 'self') and *Ishwarpranidhana* (dedication to the God/Supreme power).

### **9.7 Bandha**

### **9.7.1** *Uddiyana Bandha*

In Sanskrit, *uddiyana* means 'raising up' and *bandha* means 'contraction' of any part of the body. This may be called *uddiyana* because it raises the diaphragm up. In this *bandha*, the diaphragm is made to fly up from its original position and held very high in the thoracic cavity.

This *bandha* exercises the diaphragm and the ribs. It can be practised either in sitting or in standing position.

### **Let us perform** *Uddiyana Bandha* **by following the steps given below:**

- 1. Sit in *Padmasana, Vajrasana* or *Sukhasana.* Keep the hands on knees.
- 2. Exhale through the mouth emptying the lungs as much as possible. Hold the breath outside and press down the knees with palms.
- 3. Form a pit in the abdomen. For making the pit, contract the abdominal muscles inward towards the spine and upwards (abdominal lock). Hold the breath outside with abdominal lock for as long as comfortable.
- 4. To come back, gradually release the abdominal lock, come slowly to the starting position and start inhaling slowly.

(Repeat it 3-4 times.)

### **9.8 Dhyana (Meditation)**

Meditation is a yogic practice by which mind becomes still and relaxed. We all know that our mind always remains active and never takes rest. All kinds of thoughts and emotions negatively affect it and as a result minds becomes disturbed. In order to pacify and relax the mind, it is to be stilled. This can be done by taking the mind away from the external things.

For pacifying and relaxing the mind, meditation is a very effective practice. It relaxes body and mind both and refuels them with energy. Several researches indicate that meditation improves the functioning of brain.

There are several techniques of meditation. They vary in the methodology but the goal of all techniques is same, i.e., reaching an inner calm and a higher level of awareness. All techniques of meditation involve focussing on a single point which could be breath, a *mantra*, a word or an object. In the beginning, focussing of the mind is difficult; therefore a beginner can start meditating for a few minutes only and later on can increase its duration.

#### **Let us practice** *meditation* **by following the steps given below:**

- 1. Sit in *Padmasana, Sukhasana* or in any meditative comfortable posture. Place your hands in *Jnana mudra*  on your respective knees. Keep your spine erect. Close your eyes gently.
- 2. Breathe normally.

Chapter-9 Yoga.indd 148 08-11-2016 11:42:16 AM

- 3. Focus your attention on the breath. Go inside yourself and observe your breathing. Concentrate on inhalation and exhalation. During the practice, your mind may wander here and there. Try to concentrate on your breath only. Breathe normally.
- 4. Now you can focus on the space between the eyebrows with closed eyes. Remain in this position for five minutes.
- 5. To come back, bring your consciousness very slowly back to the external surroundings.
- 6. Cup the eyes with the hands and blink the eyes for a few seconds so that sudden exposure to light does not irritate them. Slowly open your eyes and remove the hands. Slowly externalise yourself.

Meditation can be performed in different forms. For example, instead of breath, one may focus on sound also. For this, slowly produce the sound, keep on reducing its volume till it comes to a barely audible note. Then stay calm and concentrate on the tip of the nose or the space between the eyebrows with closed eyes.

#### **Benefits**

- • It gives deeper relaxation.
- • It lowers heart rate and blood pressure.
- • It slows respiratory rate.
- • It helps to reduce stress.
- • It helps in managing emotions.

### **Introspection**

In addition to above yogic practices, you can practise introspection for personality development. Introspection means inner inspection or self observation. It also means looking within. Introspection is an important method by which a person becomes aware about the self. This practice makes us aware about our strengths and weaknesses. Introspection can be done anytime.

You can practise introspection before going to bed.

### **Let us practise introspection by following the steps given below:**

- 1. Sit in *Padmasana* or any other comfortable meditation pose.
- 2. Close your eyes.
- 3. Observe your breaths. Focus your mind on your breath only. Many unwanted thoughts may come to your mind and disturb you but try to focus on breath only.

Chapter-9 Yoga.indd 149 08-11-2016 11:42:16 AM

	- • Did you waste your time on unnecessary activities?

- 5. Analyse your behaviour. If you find mistakes in your behaviour then make a resolve not to repeat them again.
