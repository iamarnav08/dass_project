# **GLOSSARY**

# **Agro-climatic**

The climatic and land resource conditions in totality which are crucial for the development of agriculture and allied economic conditions of a region.

# **Aquifer**

A saturated geological unit (e.g. sands, gravels, fractured rock) which can yield water to wells at a sufficient rate to support a well.

## **Artificial Recharge to Groundwater**

Artificial Recharge to Groundwater means the process by which groundwater reservoir is augmented at a rate exceeding that under natural condition of replenishment.

## **Command Area**

The area served by a canal system through supply of water for irrigation and other purposes.

#### **Culturable command area**

It refers to the culturable land irrigated by a canal system. It is different from gross command area. The later includes all the area served by a canal system including unculturatble.

## **Eco-development**

The process of development of a region by means of conservation and regeneration of degraded ecosystem and ecological sustainability.

## **Emigration**

Movement of people from one place to another usually from one country to another with a purpose of earning, living, residing and settling.

#### **Extensive irrigation**

A strategy of irrigation development where the emphasis is on providing irrigation water for a large area. Per unit area use of water is low in this case.

#### **Flow system or channel**

A channel of canal where water flows under the influence of gravity.

## **Groundwater**

Groundwater means the water which exists below the ground surface in the zone of saturation and can be extracted through wells or any other means or emerges as springs and base flows in streams and rivers.

## **Groundwater Table**

The top of the zone in which all pore spaces or fissures are totally filled with water.

#### **Immigration**

Movement of a person as a permanent resident into another area, usually into a foreign country.

## **Intrusive irrigation**

A strategy of irrigation development where per unit application of water is high.

#### **Lift system or channel**

A channel of canal where water is forced to flow against the slope of land by upliftment.

# **Migration**

Movement of the people for the specific purpose from one place to another in the country or to a foreign country.

#### **Migration stream**

Migration stream refers to a group of migrants with the common origin and destination.

# **Net migration or balance of migration**

The difference of total numbers of persons arrived in and left out the place. In other words, it is sum of in migrants and immigrants minus sum of out migrants and emigrants. In mathematical term it is defined as:

# **Net migration**

(in migrants + immigrants) - (out migrants + emigrants)

#### **Rainwater Harvesting**

Rain Water Harvesting is the technique of collection and storage of rain water at surface or in sub-surface aquifer.

# **Refugee**

People who are forced to take shelter in other country due to life threatening situation, insecurity, war or violation of human rights in their own country.

# **Remittance**

All cash or kinds sent by the migrants to their place of origin. Money order is one form of remittance.

#### **Transhuemance**

The practice of seasonal migration where the pastoral communities migrate to the pastures along with their herds during summer season. These communities return to their permanent residence in winter.

# **Warebandi system**

It is a system of equitable distribution of water in the command area of canal outlet.

## **Watershed**

A watershed is a natural geo-hydrological unit of land, which collects water and drains it through a common point by a system of streams. Such a unit can be a small area of a few hectares or it could be an area of hundreds of square kilometres like the Ganga river basin.
