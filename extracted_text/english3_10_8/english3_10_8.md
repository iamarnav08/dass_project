**Death Is Nothing At All**

Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened.

Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged.

Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.

Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.

Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together.

Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.

Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.

Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident?

Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner.

All is well. Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before. How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!

*Canon Henry Scott Holland*

### **Reading Comprehension**

### **Text I**

Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

In the future, if we want a happier humanity, a happy world, we must tackle the root of the problem. Of course the economy and political power are also causes. But the ultimate cause lies within the human mind. Every human action, verbal or physical,

even minor actions, have some motivation. Proper motivation or proper development is an important factor. Thus, if intelligence is accompanied with human affection and compassion, what I call human feeling, then it is very useful.

If society's moral values and standards of behaviour become negative, each of us will suffer. Therefore, the intentions of an individual are very much related to the interests of society. There is a definite correlation.

The educational system and family life are two very important areas. In the educational field, one has to take care not only of the brain, but also of one's spiritual development. I say "spiritual development" not in a religious sense but simply in the sense of having a good and compassionate heart. If one has a compassionate heart, it automatically brings inner strength and allows for less fear and less doubt. Subsequently, one becomes happier and more open-minded, thus making more friends in society.

Father Gilligan was overworked and extremely tired as he kept attending to the sick and dying among his parishioners. He was offering them spiritual comfort day and night. One night he fell asleep on a chair. God sent his angel down to help his most beloved servant of the people.

### **The Ballad of Father Gilligan**

The old priest Peter Gilligan Was weary night and day, For half his flock were in their beds, Or under green sods lay.

Once while he nodded on a chair, At the moth-hour of eve, Another poor man sent for him, And he began to grieve.

"I have no rest, nor joy, nor peace, For people die and die;" And after cried he, "God forgive! My body spake, not I!"

And then, half-lying on the chair, He knelt, prayed, fell asleep; And the moth-hour went from the fields, And stars began to peep.

They slowly into millions grew, And leaves shook in the wind; And God covered the world with shade, And whispered to mankind.

Upon the time of sparrow chirp When the moths came once more, The old priest Peter Gilligan Stood upright on the floor.

"Mavrone, Mavrone! The man has died, While I slept on the chair," He roused his horse out of its sleep And rode with little care.

He rode now as he never rode, By rocky lane and fen; The sick man's wife opened the door: "Father! You come again!"

"And is the poor man dead?" he cried. "He died an hour ago." The old priest Peter Gilligan In grief swayed to and fro.

"When you were gone he turned and died, As merry as a bird." The old priest Peter Gilligan He knelt him at that word.

"He who hath made the night of stars For souls who tire and bleed, Sent one of His great angles down To help me in my need.

### Grammar

#### **Reported Speech**

We use direct speech when we repeat someone's words and indirect speech when we use our own words to report what someone else has said. We use an appropriate reporting verb, make pronominal (relating to pronouns) changes and change certain words denoting 'nearness' in the direct form to words suggesting 'remoteness' (in time and place) in the indirect form.

It is said, "It is not how much we have, but how much we enjoy that makes happiness."

Being happy does not require everything to be good but an eye to see good in everything. One day a crow saw a swan. "This swan is so white," he thought, "and I am so black. This swan must be the happiest bird in the world."

The swan replied, "I was feeling that I was the happiest bird around. But I think the parrot is the happiest bird as it has two colours." The crow then approached the parrot. The parrot said, "I have only two colours, but the peacock has multiple colours."

The crow then visited a peacock in the zoo. "Dear peacock," the crow said, "you are so beautiful. Every day, thousands of people come to see you. You are the happiest bird on the planet."

The peacock said, "I always thought that I was the most beautiful and happy bird on the planet. But I am entrapped in this zoo. I have realised that the crow is the only bird not kept in a cage, and could happily roam everywhere."

attracts the attention of thousands of visitors round the year including national and foreign tourists, archaeologists, and historians among others.

This stupa is the oldest stone structure in India that was built during the Mauryan period. Originally commissioned in the third century BCE by Emperor Ashoka, this huge hemispherical dome consists of a central chamber. In this chamber, the relics of Lord Buddha are placed. The original construction work of this stupa was supervised by Ashoka. His wife, Devi, was the daughter of a merchant of nearby village, Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. Later, four ornamental gateways or *toranas* facing four directions and a balustrade surrounding the stupa were added in the first century BCE. The Great stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India and counted among the best conserved ancient stupas of Central India. It has been enlisted as an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1989.
