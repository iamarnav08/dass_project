Abiotic : Non-living thing. Usually refers to the physical and chemical components of an organism's *environment*.

Adiabatic Lapse Rate : The rate of change of temperature by an ascending or descending airmass. If no other non-adiabatic processes (i.e. no heat enters or leaves the system) occur (like condensation, evaporation and radiation), expansion causes the parcel of air to cool at a set rate of 0.98° per 100 m. The opposite occurs when a parcel of air descends in the atmosphere. The air in a descending parcel becomes compressed. Compression causes the temperature within the parcel to increase at a rate of 0.98° per 100 m.

Air Mass : A body of air whose temperature and humidity characteristics, acquired in source region, remain relatively constant over a horizontal distance of hundreds to thousands of km. Air masses develop their climatic characteristics by remaining stationary over a source region for a number of days. Air masses are classified according to their temperature and humidity characteristics.

Aurora : Multicoloured lights that appear in the upper *atmosphere (ionosphere)* over the polar regions and visible from locations in the middle and high latitudes. Caused by the interaction of *solar wind* with oxygen and nitrogen gas in the atmosphere. Aurora in the Northern Hemisphere are called *aurora borealis* and *aurora australis* in the Southern Hemisphere.

Batholith : A large mass of subsurface *intrusive igneous rock* that has its origins from *mantle magma*.

Big Bang : Theory about the origin of universe. It suggests that about 15 billion years ago all of the matter and energy in the *Universe* was concentrated into an area smaller than an atom. At this instant, matter, energy, space and time were not existant. Then suddenly with a bang, the Universe began to expand at an incredible rate and matter, energy, space and time came into being. As the Universe expanded, matter began to coalesce into gas clouds, and then stars and planets. Some scientists believe that this expansion is finite and will one day cease. After this point in time, the Universe will begin to collapse until a *Big Crunch* occurs.

particular time interval. Can include the dead parts of organisms like bark, hair, and nails.

Coriolis Force : An apparent force due to the *Earth's rotation*. Causes moving objects to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern hemisphere. Coriolis force does not exist on the equator. This force is responsible for the direction of flow in meteorological phenomena like *mid-latitude cyclones*, *hurricanes*, and *anticyclones.*

Cumulus Cloud : Large *clouds* with relatively flat bases. These are found in an altitude range from 300 - 2,000 m.

Earthquake Focus : Point of stress release in an *earthquake* (also known as hypocentre).

Ebb Tide : Time during the *tidal period* when the *water* level in the sea is falling.

Ecosystem : A system consisting of biotic and abiotic components. Both these groups are interrelated and interacting.

El Nino : The name given to the occasional development of warm ocean surface waters along the coast of Ecuador and Peru. Recently this phenomenon has been used for forecasting of climatic conditions in different parts of the world. The El Nino normally occurs around Christmas and lasts usually for a few weeks to a few months.

GLOSSARY 123

Epicentre : A place on the surface of the earth located at the shortest distance from the focus of the earthquake, the point at which the seismic energy gets released.

Global Warming : Warming of the Earth's *average global temperature* because of an increase in the concentration of *greenhouse gases*.

Geomagnetism : A property of magnetically susceptible minerals to get aligned to the earth's magnetic field during the period of rock formation.

Geostrophic Wind : Horizontal wind in the upper atmosphere that moves parallel to *isobars*. Results from a balance between *pressure gradient force* and *Coriolis force*.

Greenhouse Effect : The greenhouse effect causes the *atmosphere* to trap more heat energy at the Earth's surface and within the atmosphere by absorbing and re-emitting longwave energy.

Greenhouse Gases : Gases responsible for the *greenhouse effect*. These gases include: *carbon dioxide* (CO2 ); *methane* (CH4 ); *nitrous oxide* (N2O); *chlorofluorocarbons* (CFC); and *tropospheric ozone* (O3 ).

Hydrolysis : *Chemical weathering* process that involves the reaction between *mineral* ions and the ions of water (OH- and H+), and results in the decomposition of the *rock* surface by forming new compounds.

Infiltration : A portion of the precipitation which reaches the earth surface seeps into the ground in the permeable strata. This process is known as infiltration.

Insolation : Incoming solar radiation in short wave form.

Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) : Zone of *low atmospheric pressure* and ascending air located at or near the equator. Rising air currents are due to global wind *convergence* and *convection* from thermal heating.

Katabatic Wind : Any *wind* blowing down the slope of a mountain.

Land Breeze : Local *thermal circulation* pattern found at the interface between land and water. In this circulation system, surface winds blow from land to water during the night.

La Nina : Condition opposite of an *El Nino*. In a La Nina, the tropical Pacific *trade winds* become very strong and an abnormal accumulation of cold water occurs in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean.

Latent Heat : It is the energy required to change a substance to a higher state of matter (solid > liquid > gas). This same energy is released from the substance when the change of state is reversed (gas > liquid > solid).

Neap Tide : *Tide* that occurs every 14 - 15 days and coincides with the first and last quarter of the moon. This tide has a small tidal range because the *gravitational* forces of the moon and sun are perpendicular to each other.

Nimbostratus Clouds : Dark, gray low altitude *cloud* that produces continuous *precipitation* in the form of rain or snow. Found in an altitude range from the surface to 3,000 m.

Ozone : Tri-atomic oxygen that exists in the earth's *atmosphere* as a gas. Ozone is highest in concentration in the *stratosphere* (10-50 km above the earth's surface) where it absorbs the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Stratospheric ozone is produced naturally and helps to protect life from the harmful effects of solar ultraviolet radiation.

Precipitation : Showering of the raindrops, snow or hailstones from the clouds onto the surface of the earth. Rainfall, snowfall, cloud burst and hailstones are forms of precipitation.

Runoff : It is the flow of water over land through different channels.

Solar Wind : Mass of ionised gas emitted to space by the *sun*. Plays a role in the formation of *auroras*.

Subsurface flow : It is the movement of water below the surface of the earth. After infiltration, the subsurface water returns to the surface through seepage into the streams or eventually goes into the ocean. The subsurface water flow is influenced by land slope, rainfall, intensity of groundwater extraction, etc.

Thermocline : Boundary in a body of water where the greatest vertical change in *temperature* occurs. This boundary is usually the transition zone between the layer of warm water near the surface that is mixed and the cold deep water layer.
