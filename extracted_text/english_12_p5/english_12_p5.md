Emily Dickinson 1830-1886

Emily Dickinson is regarded as one of America's quintessential poets of the nineteenth century. She lived an introverted and hermetic life, and published very few of her poems in her lifetime. Her output, 1789 poems in all, were published posthumously.

Her poetry is characterised by unconventional capitalisation and extensive use of dashes, along with unusual imagery and lyric style.

The Trees like Tassels hit - and - swung -There seemed to rise a Tune From Miniature Creatures Accompanying the Sun -

Far Psalteries of Summer -Enamoring the Ear They never yet did satisfy -Remotest - when most fair

The Sun shone whole at intervals -Then Half - then utter hid -As if Himself were optional And had Estates of Cloud

Sufficient to enfold Him Eternally from view -Except it were a whim of His To let the Orchards grow -

108/*KALEIDOSCOPE*

A Bird sat careless on the fence – One gossiped in the Lane On silver matters charmed a Snake Just winding round a Stone –

Bright Flowers slit a Calyx And soared upon a Stem Like Hindered Flags – Sweet hoisted – With Spices – in the Hem –

'Twas more – I cannot mention – How mean – to those that see Vandyke's Delineation Of Nature's – Summer Day!

- 4. How would you explain the image of the 'Hindered Flags'?
- 5. Why are the pronouns referring to the Sun capitalised?
- 6. Give examples from the poem to show that great poetry is a result of close observation of natural phenomena.
