#### **Reading Comprehension**

#### **Text I**

Given below is a story of the tailor who has been known for his skills in cheating and stealing. Read in groups of four or in pairs. You may discuss the events and incidences of the story with your friends and write them in a sequential manner.

#### **The Trader and the Tailor**

There was a tailor who was known for beating others in the art of being light-fingered and thievery. A trader swore that even with a hundred attempts, the tailor would not be able to take a coil of thread from him without his knowledge.

The trader was told that many others, more intelligent than him, had been beaten by the tailor. They said he should not imagine himself so great, for his ego would only give him worse troubles in competition with the tailor. Still, the trader became more competitive and made a wager that the tailor would not be able to rob him of anything.

He wagered an Arab horse with those who taunted him. If the tailor failed to steal, then they would have to give him a horse instead. That night, the trader lay awake troubled by the situation and could not sleep a wink.

In the morning, he put a piece of satin cloth under his arm and went to the bazaar and entered the shop and saluted the cunning rogue warmly. The tailor sprang up from his seat and welcomed the trader, inquiring about his health with cordiality exceeding even that of the trader, planting in his heart great feelings of affection for him. When the trader heard these songs of sweetness from the tailor, he flung down the piece of silk saying, "Cut this into a coat for me and make it wide below my navel so as not to hamper my legs and tight about it to show off my figure."

The tailor answered, "O! kindly man, I will do you a hundred services," and accepted the order. He measured the satin and inspected the working surface and all the time chatted away to the trader in idle gossip, about other amirs and of bounties and gifts he had received from them, and about misers and their mean ways, and made the trader laugh with hysterics. During this beguiling talk, he was snipping away with his scissors rapidly, cutting as fast as his lips moved.

The trader was laughing, the tailor was cutting, the trader closed his eyes in joy, the tailor cut extra pieces, tucking them under his thighs, hidden away from all but God. From his delight at the tailor's tales, the trader's former boast went out of his mind. What satin? What boast? What wager? The trader was drunk on the jokes told by the tailor.

Then the tailor told such an incredible story that the trader fell over on his back with laughter. The tailor swiftly stitched a swatch of the satin to the hem of his underpants while the trader was paying no attention at all, greedily sucking with every guffaw at the jests the tailor told. The tailor continued to tell funnier and funnier tales and jokes until the trader was completely within his power.

With his eyes shut and his reason vanished, the bewildered and boastful trader was drunk with joy. And the tailor continued to cut, filching yet more of the beautiful cloth, with nothing to stop him now. And yet the trader begged for more.

*You who becomes the slave of the jest, no story is more laughable than you yourself, think on this at the edge of your grave. How long will you listen to the lies of this world that leave your mind and spirit unhinged? The Universal Tailor will cut and stitch the hems of a hundred travellers, silly as children.*

Eventually the tailor became bored with the whole story and told the trader that he better leave before another tale was told, "For if I tell another one, the coat will be too tight for you, and you will stop laughing and weep tears of blood."

Speaking

1. Lencho, the main character in the story, is a farmer. He supports his family through farming. The conflict in the story happens when a hailstorm strikes the field and destroys his farm. All the hard work, for nothing! The entire land is wrecked by catastrophe. There is no one who can help. Lencho's complete faith in God is amazing during the calamity.

So, one type of conflict dominating in the story is man versus nature. Discuss with your partner the natural calamities that play havoc in the lives of people. Collect photographs and make a visual presentation to share in the class.

- 2. Try writing a small poem on the topic man versus nature. Read aloud the poem with the required stress and intonation. Given below is a poem written by Norman Littleford, which may help you think and compose.
Unit-1.indd 10 27-Jun-2019 04:21:16 PM

#### **Man vs Nature**

The heavens roared with thunder as lightning filled the skies was this God getting angry or Nature's big surprise. Is Mother Nature telling us the best way that she can to stop the interference and abuse she gets from man.

We marvel at her beauty each time we look around then dig up all her treasures from their natural burial ground. We forget that Nature gives us all that keeps us living we take it all and still want more but never think of giving. We build across the countryside progressing every day but Mother Nature can't progress for man is in the way.

*Norman Littleford*

### Writing

What makes them different? Working in pairs, list the actions and qualities of Lencho and the tailor and draw their character sketches.

- 1. You may have come across some people in your neighbourhood who might have inspired you with their actions. Talk to them about—
	- their childhood, their education, job, their likes and dislikes
	- their contribution to the enrichment of their village or town, job, country, etc.
	- their interesting features and characteristics

Request for their pictures. Based on the collected information, write their portraits and present it to the class. You may read on 'How to do project work?' given below.

#### **How to do project work in the English language classroom?**

In addition to the textbook activities, project work could be used as an effective strategy to promote collaborative ways of language learning where we work together in groups to do an activity. We collect information, ideas; observe the language being used; use language in real life situations; exchange views and debate on ideas; write the ideas into a report; edit our writing and produce the report in a suitable form. This helps in constructing ideas and analysing critical judgments of the peers to arrive at a decision or conclusion.

It would be of much benefit to learners, if projects planned are of an interdisciplinary nature.

#### **Designing and managing projects**

There are many ways students can be initiated to carry out projects.

- Read books, newspapers, listen to the radio, watch TV, consult websites and encyclopedia, talk to people, observe events and proceedings, interview people, record audio/ video, collect pictures and illustrations, interpret them, and report.
- Write field notes to remember and organise the data collected.

# Project

- Bring your own ideas to the class and have a class discussion.
- Use language meaningfully and precisely. If the meaning of learning is 'meaning making', the purpose is achieved fully while doing projects.
- Learners should do the projects in group independently. They should not ask their parents to do these or buy readymade products available in the market.
- They may seek information or some help from parents or elders.

#### **Planning, writing the draft and editing**

Having collected the required data, information and ideas, plan and organise the data and interpret them to write the draft. It could be posters, a script of a play (enact and direct a play), songs, essays, etc. Editing is an important part of writing the report. Students should be made aware of process approach involved in writing a good piece of work. Then present it to the whole class or to the school during the assembly or on special occasions (in case of play, songs, etc.).
