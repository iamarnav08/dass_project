You have learnt that financial accounting is a well-defined sequential activity which begins with Journal (Journalising), Ledger (Posting), and preparation of Trial Balance (Balancing and Summarisation at the first stage). In the present chapter, we will take up the next step, namely, preparation of financial statements, and discuss the types of information requirements of various stakeholders, the distinction between capital and revenue items and its importance and the nature of financial statements and the preparation thereof.

## **8.1 Stakeholders and their Information Requirements**

Recall from chapter I (Financial Accounting Part I) that the objective of business is to communicate the meaningful information to various stakeholders in the business so that they can make informed decisions. A stakeholder is any person associated with the business. The stakes of various stakeholders can be monetary or non-monetary. The stakes can be active or passive; or can be direct or indirect. The owner and persons advancing loan to the business would have monetary stake. The government, consumer or a researcher will have non-monetary stake in the business. The stakeholders are also called users who are normally classified as *internal*  and *external* depending upon whether they are inside the business or outside the business. All users have different objectives for joining business and

Ch-8.indd 277 9/13/2022 2:49:08 PM

consequently different types of information requirements from it. In nutshell, the various users have diverse financial information requirements from the business.

For example we have classified the following into the category of internal and external users specifying their objectives and consequent information requirements.

| Name | Internal/ | Objective for participating | Accounting Information requirements |

Accounting Process (up to Trial balance) :

- 1. Identify the transactions, which that are recorded.
- 2. Record transactions in journal. Only those transactions are recorded which are measured in money terms. The system followed for recording is called double entry system whereby two aspects (debit and credit) of every transaction are recorded. Repeated transactions of same nature are recorded in subsidiary books, also called special journals. Instead of recording all transactions in journal, they are recorded in subsidiary books and the journal proper. For example, the business would record all credit sales in sales book and all credit purchases in purchases book. The other examples of subsidiary books are return inwards book, return outwards book. An other important special book is cash book, in which all cash and bank transactions are recorded. The entries, which are not recorded in any of these books, are recorded in a residual journal called *journal proper*.
- 3. The entries appearing in the above books are posted in the respective accounts in the ledger.
- 4. The accounts are balanced and listed in a statement called *trial balance*. If the total amounts of debit and credit balances agree, accounts are taken as free from arithmetical errors.
- 5. The trial balance forms the basis for making the financial statements, i.e. trading and profit and loss account and balance sheet.

## **8.2 Distinction between Capital and Revenue**

A very important distinction in accounting is between capital and revenue items. The distinction has important implications for making of the trading and profit and loss account and balance sheet. The revenue items form part of the trading and profit and loss account, the capital items help in the preparation of a balance sheet.

## *8.2.1 Expenditure*

Whenever payment and/or incurrence of an outlay are made for a purpose other than the settlement of an existing liability, it is called expenditure. The expenditures are incurred with a viewpoint they would give benefits to the business. The benefit of an expenditure may extend up to one accounting year or more than one year. If the benefit of expenditure extends up to one accounting period, it is termed as *revenue expenditure*. Normally, they are incurred for the day-to-day conduct of the business. An example can be payment of salaries, rent, etc. The salaries paid in the current period will not benefit the business in the next accounting period, as the workers have put in their efforts in the current accounting period. They will have to be paid the salaries in the next accounting period as well if they are made to work. If the benefit of expenditure extends more than one accounting period, it is termed

Ch-8.indd 279 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

as *capital expenditure*. An example can be payment to acquire furniture for use in the business. Furniture acquired in the current accounting period will give benefits for many accounting periods to come. The usual examples of capital expenditure can be payment to acquire fixed assets and/or to make additions/ extensions in the fixed assets.

Following points of distinction between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure are worth noting :

- (a) Capital expenditure increases earning capacity of business whereas revenue expenditure is incurred to maintain the earning capacity.
- (b) Capital expenditure is incurred to acquire fixed assets for operation of business whereas revenue expenditure is incurred on day-to-day conduct of business.
- (c) Revenue expenditure is generally recurring expenditure and capital expenditure is non-recurring by nature.
- (d) Capital expenditure benefits more than one accounting year whereas revenue expenditure normally benefits one accounting year.
- (e) Capital expenditure (subject to depreciation) is recorded in balance sheet whereas revenue expenditure (subject to adjustment for outstanding and prepaid amount) is transferred to trading and profit and loss account.

Sometimes, it becomes difficult to classify the expenditure into revenue or capital category. In normal usage, the advertising expenditure is termed as revenue expenditure. The heavy expenditure incurred on advertising is likely to benefit the business firm for more than one accounting period. Such revenue expenditures, which are likely to give benefit for more than one accounting period, are termed as *deferred revenue expenditure*.

It must be understood that expenditure is a wider term and includes expenses. Expenditure is any outlay made/incurred by the business firm. The part of the expenditure, which is perceived to have been used or consumed in the current year, is termed as expense of the current year.

Revenue expenditure is treated as an expense for the current year and is shown in trading and profit and loss account. For example, salary paid by the business firm is treated as an expense of the current year. Capital expenditures are charged to income statement and are spread over to more than one accounting period. Hence, furniture of ` 50,000 if expected to be used for 5 years will be treated as expense @ ` 10,000 per year. The name given for the expense is depreciation. The treatment of deferred revenue expenditure is same as of capital expenditure. They are also written-off over their expected period of benefit.

Ch-8.indd 280 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

## *8.2.2 Receipts*

The similar treatment is given to the receipts of the business. If the receipts imply an obligation to return the money, these are capital receipts. The example can be an additional capital brought in by the owner or a loan taken from the bank. Both receipts are leading to obligations, the first to the owner (called equity) and the other to the outsiders (called liabilities). Another example on a capital receipt can be the sale of a fixed asset like old machinery or furniture. However, if a receipt does not incur an obligation to return the money or is not in the form of a sale of fixed asset, it is termed as revenue receipt. The examples of revenue receipts sales made by the firm and interest on investment received by the firm.

## *8.2.3 Importance of Distinction between Capital and Revenue*

As stated earlier, the distinction between capital and revenue items has important implications for the preparation of trading and profit and loss account and the balance sheet as all items of revenue value are to the shown in the trading and profit and loss account and the items of capital nature in the balance sheet. If any item is wrongly classified, i.e. if any item of revenue nature is treated as capital item or vice-versa, the ascertainment of profit or loss will be incorrect. For example, the revenues earned during an accounting period are ` 10,00,000 and the expenses shown are ` 8,00,000, the profit shall work out as ` 2,00,000. On scrutiny of the details, you find that a revenue item of ` 20,000 (an expenditure on repairs of machinery) has been treated as capital expenditure (added to the cost of machinery and debited to machinery account, not to repairs account), and hence, does not form part of the expenses for the period. It means the actual expenses for the period are ` 8,20,000 and not ` 8,00,000. So, the correct profit is ` 1,80,000, not ` 2,00,000. In other words, the profit has been over stated. Similarly, if any capital expenditure is wrongly shown as revenue expenditure (for example, purchase of furniture shown as purchases), it will result in under statement of profits, and also an under statement of assets. Thus, the financial statements will not reflect the true and fair view of the affairs of the business. Hence, it is necessary to identify the correct nature of each item and treat it accordingly in the book of accounts. It is also important from taxation point of view because capital profits are taxed differently from revenue profits.

## **8.3 Financial Statements**

It has been emphasised that various users have diverse informational requirements. Instead of generating particular information useful for specific users, the business prepares a set of financial statements, which in general satisfies the informational needs of the users.

Ch-8.indd 281 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

The basic objectives of preparing financial statements are :

- (a) To present a true and fair view of the financial performance of the business;
- (b) To present a true and fair view of the financial position of the business; and

For this purpose, the firm usually prepares the following financial statements:

- 1. Trading and Profit and Loss Account
- 2. Balance Sheet1

Trading and Profit and Loss account, also known as Income statement, shows the financial performance in the form of profit earned or loss sustained by the business. Balance Sheet shows financial position in the form of assets, liabilities and capital. These are prepared on the basis of trial balance and additional information, if any.

#### *Example 1*

Observe the following trial balance of Ankit and signify correctly the various elements of accounts and you will notice that the debit balances represent either assets or expenses/ losses and the credit balance represent either equity/liabilities or revenue/gains.

[This trial balance of Ankit will be used throughout the chapter to understand the process of preparation of financial statements]

## **8.4 Trading and Profit and Loss Account**

Trading and Profit and Loss account is prepared to determine the profit earned or loss sustained by the business enterprise during the accounting period. It is basically a summary of revenues and expenses of the business and calculates the net figure termed as profit or loss. Profit is revenue *less* expenses. If expenses are more than revenues, the figure is termed as *loss*. Trading and Profit and Loss account summarises the performance for an accounting period. It is achieved by transferring the balances of revenues and expenses to the trading and profit and loss account from the trial balance. Trading and Profit and Loss account is also an account with *Debit and Credit* sides. It can be observed that debit balances (representing expenses) and losses are transferred to the debit side of the Trading and a Profit and Loss account and credit balance (representing revenues/gains) are transfered to its credit side.

## *8.4.1 Relevant Items in Trading and Profit and Loss Account*

The different items appearing in the trading and profit and loss account are explained hereunder:

*Items on the debit side*

- (i) *Opening stock* : It is the stock of goods in hand at the beginning of the accounting year. This is the stock of goods which has been carried
Ch-8.indd 283 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

forward from the previous year and remains unchanged during the year and appears in the trial balance. In the trading account it appears on the debit side because it forms the part of cost of goods sold for the current accounting year.

- (ii) *Purchases less returns* : Goods, which have been bought for resale appears as purchases on the debit side of the trading account. They include both cash as well as credit purchases. Goods which are returned to suppliers are termed as purchases return. It is shown by way of deduction from purchases and the computed amount is known as *Net purchases*.
- (iii) *Wages* : Wages refer to renumeration paid to workers who are directly engaged in factory for loading, unloading and production of goods and are debited to trading account.
- (iv) *Carriage inwards/Freight inwards:* These expenses are the items of transport expenses, which are incurred on bringing materials/goods purchased to the place of business. These items are paid in respect of purchases made during the year and are debited to the trading account.
- (v) *Fuel/Water/Power/Gas* : These items are used in the production process and hence are part of expenses.
- (vi) *Packaging material and Packing charges* : Cost of packaging material used in the product are direct expenses as it refers to small containers which form part of goods sold. However, the packing refers to the big containers that are used for transporting the goods and is regarded as an indirect expense debited to profit and loss account.
- (vii) *Salaries* : These include salaries paid to the administration, godown and warehouse staff for the services rendered by them for running the business. If salaries are paid in kind by providing certain facilities (called perks) to the employees such as rent free accommodation, meals, uniform, medical facilities should also be regarded as salaries and debited to the profit and loss account.
- (viii) *Rent paid* : These include office and godown rent, municipal rates and taxes, factory rent, rates and taxes. The amount of rent paid is shown on the debit side of the profit and loss account.
	- (ix) *Interest paid* : Interest paid on loans, bank overdraft, renewal of bills of exchange, etc. is an expense and is debited to profit and loss account.
	- (x) *Commission paid:* Commission paid or payable on business transactions undertaken through the agents is an item of expense and is debited to profit and loss account.

Ch-8.indd 284 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

- (xi) *Repairs* : Repairs and small renewals/ replacements relating to plant and machinery, furniture, fixtures, fittings, etc. for keeping them in working condition are included under this head. Such expenditure is debited to profit and loss account.
- (xii) *Miscellaneous expenses* : Though expenses are classified and booked under different heads, but certain expenses being of small amount clubbed together and are called miscellaneous expenses. In normal usage these expenses are called *Sundry expenses* or *Trade expenses*.

*Items on the credit side*

- (i) *Sales less returns* : Sales account in trial balance shows gross total sales(cash as well as credit) made during the year. It is shown on the credit side of the trading account. Goods returned by customers are called return inwards and are shown as deduction from total sales and the computed amount is known as net sales.
- (ii) *Other incomes* : Besides salaries and other gains and incomes are also recorded in the profit and loss account. Examples of such incomes are rent received, dividend received, interest received, discount received, commission received, etc.

## *8.4.2 Closing Entries*

The preparation of trading and profit and loss account requires that the balances of accounts of all concerned items are transferred to it for its compilation.

- Opening stock account, Purchases account, Wages account, Carriage inwards account and direct expenses account are closed by transferring to the debit side of the trading and profit and loss account.
This is done by recording the following entry :

Trading A/c Dr. To Opening stock A/c To Purchases A/c To Wages A/c To Carriage inwards A/c To All other direct expenses A/c

- The purchases returns or return outwards are closed by transferring its balance to the purchases account. The following entry is recorded for this purpose :

As result of the foregoing discussion, we will now learn how the trading and profit and loss account can be prepared from the trial balance, the format of which is shown in figure 8.2. However, this list is not exhaustive. In real sense, there can be many more of other items, which we will be dealing at the later stage and there you will notice how this format undergoes a change with respect to each one of them.

## *8.4.3 Concept of Gross Profit and Net Profit*

The trading and profit and loss can be seen as combination of two accounts, viz. Trading account and Profit and Loss account. The trading account or the first part ascertains the *gross profit* and profit and loss account or the second part ascertains *net profit*.

## *Trading Account*

The trading account ascertains the result from basic operational activities of the business. The basic operational activity involves the manufacturing, purchasing and selling of goods. It is prepared to ascertain whether the selling

Ch-8.indd 288 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

of goods and/or rendering of services to customers have proved profitable for the business or not. Purchases is one of the main constituents of expenses in business organisation. Besides purchases, the remaining expenses are divided into two categories, viz. *direct expenses and indirect* expenses.

*Direct expenses* means all expenses directly connected with the manufacture, purchase of goods and bringing them to the point of sale. Direct expenses include carriage inwards, freight inwards, wages, factory lighting, coal, water and feul, royalty on production, etc. In our example-1, besides purchases, four more items of expenses are listed. These are wages, salaries, rent of building and bad debts. Out of these items, wages is treated as *direct expense* while the other three are treated as *indirect expenses*.

Similarly, *sales* constitute the main item of revenue for the business. The excess of sales over purchases and direct expenses is called *gross profit*. If the amount of purchases including direct expenses is more than the sales revenue, the resultant figure is *gross loss*. The computation of gross profit can be shown in the form of equation as :

Gross Profit = Sales – (Purchases + Direct Expenses)

The gross profit or the gross loss is transferred to profit and loss account.

The *indirect expenses* are transferred to the debit side of the second part, viz. profit and loss account. All revenue/gains other than *sales* are transferred to the credit side of the profit and loss account. If the total of the credit side of the profit and loss account is more than the total of the debit side, the difference is the *net profit* for the period of which it is being prepared. On the other hand, if the total of the debit side is more than the total of the credit side, the difference is the *net loss* incurred by the business firm. In an equation form, it is shown as follows :

Net Profit = Gross Profit + Other Incomes – Indirect Expenses Net profit or net loss so computed is transferred to the capital account in the balance sheet by way of the following entry :

**Fig. 8.3 :** *Showing the computation of gross profit and net profit of Ankit*

Gross profit, which represents the basic operational activity of the business is computed as ` 42,000. The gross profit is transferred from trading account to profit and loss account. Besides gross profit, business has earned an income of ` 5,000 as commission received and has spent ` 42,500 (` 25,000 + `13,000 + `4,500) on expenses/losses including salaries, rent and bad debts. Therefore, the net profit is calculated as ` 4,500.

**Fig. 8.4 :** *An illutrative trading account of Ankit*

Ch-8.indd 293 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

If there is no opening or closing stock, the total of purchases and direct expenses is taken as *Cost of goods sold*. In our example, notice that purchases amount to ` 75,000 and wages amounts to ` 8,000. Hence, the cost of goods sold will be computed using the following formula :

Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses = $75,000+$ 8,000 = $83,000$

As there is no unsold stock, the presumption here is that all the goods purchased have been sold. But in practice, there is some unsold goods at the end of the accounting period.

In our example, let us assume that out of the goods purchased amounting to ` 75,000 in the current year, Ankit is able to sell goods costing ` 60,000 only. In such a situation, the business will have an unsold stock of goods costing ` 15,000 in hand, also called closing stock. The amount of cost of goods sold will be computed as per the following equation :

> Cost of Goods Sold = Purchases + Direct Expenses – Closing Stock = ` 75,000 + ` 8,000 – ` 15,000

As a result, the amount of gross profit will also change with the existence of closing stock in business from ` 42,000 (as computed in figure 8.4) to ` 57,000 (refer figure 8.5).

| Expenses/Losses | Amount | Revenues/Gains | Amount |

It may be noted that closing stock does not normally form part of trial balance, and is brought into books with the help of the following journal entry :

> Closing stock A/c Dr. To Trading A/c

This entry opens a new account of asset, i.e. closing stock ` 15,000 which is transferred to the balance sheet. The closing stock shall be an opening stock for the next year and shall be sold during the year. In most cases, therefore, the business shall have opening stock as well as closing stock every year, and the cost of goods sold should be worked as per the following equation:

Cost of Goods Sold = Opening Stock+Purchases Direct Expenses–Closing Stock

Look at Illustration 5 and see how it has been computed.

## **8.5 Operating Profit (EBIT)**

It is the profit earned through the normal operations and activities of the business. Operating profit is the excess of operating revenue over operating expenses. While calculating operating profit, the incomes and expenses of a purely financial nature are not taken into account. Thus, operating profit is profit before interest and tax (EBIT). Similarly, abnormal items such as loss by fire, etc. are also not taken into account. It is calculated as follows:

Operating profit = Net Profit +Non Operating Expenses – Non Operating Incomes

Refer to the trial balance of Ankit in example 1 (Page no. 294), you will notice that it depicts an item relating to 10% interest on long-term loan raised on April 01, 2017. The amount of interest works out to ` 500 (` 5,000 × 10/100), which has been shown on the debit side of the trading and profit and loss account (figure 8.6).

## **8.6 Balance Sheet**

The balance sheet is a statement prepared for showing the financial position of the business summarising its assets and liabilities at a given date. The assets reflect debit balances and liabilities (including capital) reflect credit balances.

Ch-8.indd 299 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

It is prepared at the end of the accounting period after the trading and profit and loss account have been prepared. It is called balance sheet because it is a statement of balances of ledger accounts that have not been transferred to trading and profit and loss account and are to be carried forward to the next year with the help of an opening entry made in the journal at the beginning of the next year.

## *8.6.1 Preparing Balance Sheet*

All the account of assets, liabilities and capital are shown in the balance sheet. Accounts of capital and liabilities are shown on the left hand side, known as *Liabilities.* Assets and other debit balances are shown on the right hand side, known as *Assets.* There is no prescribed form of Balance sheet, for a proprietary and partnership firms. (However, *Schedule III Part I of the Companies Act 2013* prescribes the format and the order in which the assets and liabilities of a company should be shown). The horizontal format in which the balance sheet is prepared is shown in the figure 8.7.

## *8.6.2 Relevant Items in the Balance Sheet*

Items which are generally included in a balance sheet are explained below :

- (1) *Current Assets:* Current assets are those which are either in the form of cash or a can be converted into cash within a year.

Ch-8.indd 301 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

- (2) *Current Liabilities*: Current liabilities are those liabilities which are expected to be paid within a year and which are usually to be paid out of current assets. The examples of such liabilities are bank overdraft, bills payable, sundry creditors, short-term loans, outstanding expenses, etc.
- (3) *Fixed Assets:* Fixed assets are those assets, which are held on a long-term basis in the business. Such assets are not acquired for the purpose of resale, e.g. land, building, plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, etc. Some times the term 'Fixed Block' or 'Block Capital' is also used for them.
- (4) *Intangible Assets :* These are such assets which cannot be seen or touched. Goodwill, Patents, Trademarks are some of the examples of intangible assets.
- (5) *Investments:* Investments represent the funds invested in government securities, shares of a company, etc. They are shown at cost price. If, on the date of preparation the balance sheet, the market price of investments is lower than the cost price, a footnote to that effect may be appended to the balance sheet.
- (6) *Long-term Liabilities* : All liabilities other than the current liabilities are known as long-term liabilities. Such liabilities are usually payable after one year of the date of the balance sheet. The important items of long term liabilities are long-term loans from bank and other financial institutions.
- (7) *Capital:* It is the excess of assets over liabilities due to outsiders. It represents the amount originally contributed by the proprietor/ partners as increased by profits and interest on capital and decreased by losses drawings and intrest on drawings.
- (8) *Drawings* : Amount withdrawn by the proprietor is termed as drawings and has the effect of reducing the balance on his capital account. Therefore, the drawings account is closed by transferring its balance to his capital account. However it is shown by way of deduction from capital in the balance sheet.

## *8.6.3 Marshalling and Grouping of Assets and Liabilities*

A major concern of accounting is about preparing and presenting the financial statement. The information so provided should be decision useful for the users. Therefore, it becomes necessary that the items appearing in the balance sheet should be properly *grouped* and presented in a particular order.

#### *Marshalling of Assets and Liabilities*

In a balance sheet, the assets and liabilities are arranged either in the order of *liquidity* or *permanence*. Arrangement of assets and liabilities in a particular order is known as Marshalling.

In case of *permanence*, the most permanent asset or liability is put on the top in the balance sheet and thereafter the assets are arranged in their reducing level of permanence.

Ch-8.indd 302 9/13/2022 2:49:09 PM

In the balance sheet of Ankit you will find that furniture is the most permanent of all the assets. Out of debtors, bank and cash, debtors will take maximum time to convert back into cash. Bank is less liquid than cash. Cash is the most liquid of all the assets. Similarly, on the liabilities side, the capital, being the most important source of finance will tend to remain in the business for a longer period than the long-term loan. Creditors being a liquid liability will be discharged in the near future. The balance sheet of Ankit in the order of permanence is shown in figure 8.10(a).

| Liabilities |  | Amount | Assets | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | ` |  | ` |
| Capital | 12,000 |  | Furniture | 15,000 |
| Add Profit | 4,500 | 16,500 | Debtors | 15,500 |
| 10 % Long-term loan ­ |  | 5,000 | Bank | 5,000 |
| Creditors |  | 15,000 | Cash | 1,000 |
|  |  | 36,500­ ­ |  | 36,500 |

**Balance Sheet of Ankit as on March 31, 2017 (in order of permanence)**

|  |

In case of *liquidity*, the order is reversed. The information presented in this manner would enable the user to have a good idea about the life of the various accounts. The assets account of the relatively permanent nature would continue in the business for a longer time whereas the less permanent or more liquid accounts will change their forms in the near future and are likely to become cash or cash equivalent.

The balance sheet of Ankit in the order of liquidity is shown in figure 8.10(b)

## *Grouping of Assets and Liabilities*

The items appearing in the balance sheet can also be properly grouped. The term grouping means putting together items of similar nature under a common heading. For example, the balance of accounts of cash, bank, debtors, etc. can be grouped and shown under the heading of 'current assets' and the balances of all fixed assets and long-term investment under the heading of 'non-current assets'.

| Liabilities |  | Amount | Assets | Amount |
