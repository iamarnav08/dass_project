# **9.1 Introduction**

We are familiar with two-dimensional *coordinate geometry* from earlier classes. Mainly, it is a combination of *algebra* and *geometry*. A systematic study of geometry by the use of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book 'La Géométry, published in 1637. This book introduced the notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical methods into the study of geometry. The resulting combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as *analytical geometry.* In the earlier classes, we initiated the study of coordinate geometry, where we studied about coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a

![](_page_0_Picture_6.jpeg)

plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the basics of coordinate geometry.

Let us have a brief recall of coordinate geometry done in earlier classes. To recapitulate, the location of the points (6, – 4) and

(3, 0) in the XY-plane is shown in Fig 9.1.

We may note that the point (6, – 4) is at 6 units distance from the *y*-axis measured along the positive *x*-axis and at 4 units distance from the *x*-axis measured along the negative *y*-axis. Similarly, the point (3, 0) is at 3 units distance from the *y*-axis measured along the positive *x*-axis and has zero distance from the *x*-axis.

We also studied there following important formulae:

![](_page_0_Figure_12.jpeg)

- **I.** Distance between the points P (*x*1, *y*1 ) and Q (*x*2 , *y*2 ) is

$$\mathrm{PQ}{=}{\sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}}$$

For example, distance between the points (6, – 4) and (3, 0) is

$\sqrt{(3-6)^{2}+(0+4)^{2}}=\sqrt{9+16}=5$ units.  
  

**II.** The coordinates of a point dividing the line segment joining the points (*x*1, *y*1 )

and $(x_{2},y_{2})$ internally, in the ratio $m$: $n$ are $\left(\frac{m\,x_{2}+n\,x_{1}}{m+n},\frac{m\,y_{2}+n\,y_{1}}{m+n}\right)$.  
  

For example, the coordinates of the point which divides the line segment joining

A (1, –3) and B (–3, 9) internally, in the ratio 1: 3 are given by 1 ( 3) 3 1 0 1 3 *. . x* − + = = +

$${\mathrm{~and~}}y={\frac{1.9+3.\left(-3\right)}{1+3}}=0.$$

**III.** In particular, if *m* = *n*, the coordinates of the mid-point of the line segment

joining the points $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$ are $\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2},\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}\right)$.  
  

**IV.** Area of the triangle whose vertices are (*x*1, *y*1 ), (*x*2 , *y*2 ) and (*x*3 , *y*3 ) is

$$\left|\right.x_{1}(y_{2}-y_{3})+x_{2}(y_{3}-y_{1})+x_{3}(y_{1}-y_{2})\left|\right.$$

For example, the area of the triangle, whose vertices are (4, 4), (3, – 2) and (– 3, 16) is

.

$${\frac{1}{2}}\bigl|4(-2-16)+3(16-4)+(-3)(4+2)\bigr|={\frac{\bigl|}{2}}=27.$$

*Remark* If the area of the triangle ABC is zero, then three points A, B and C lie on a line, i.e., they are collinear.

In the this Chapter, we shall continue the study of coordinate geometry to study properties of the simplest geometric figure – *straight line.* Despite its simplicity, the line is a vital concept of geometry and enters into our daily experiences in numerous interesting and useful ways. Main focus is on representing the line algebraically, for which *slope* is most essential.

## **9.2 Slope of a Line**

A line in a coordinate plane forms two angles with the *x*-axis, which are supplementary.

The angle (say) θ made by the line *l* with positive direction of *x*-axis and measured anti clockwise is called the *inclination of the line*. Obviously 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° (Fig 9.2).

We observe that lines parallel to *x*-axis, or coinciding with *x*-axis, have inclination of 0°. The inclination of a vertical line (parallel to or coinciding with *y*-axis) is 90°.

**Definition 1** If θ is the inclination of a line *l*, then tan θ is called the *slope* or *gradient* of the line *l*.

The slope of a line whose inclination is 90° is not defined.

The slope of a line is denoted by *m*.

Thus, *m* = tan θ, θ ≠ 90°

It may be observed that the slope of *x*-axis is zero and slope of *y*-axis is not defined.

**9.2.1** *Slope of a line when coordinates of any two points on the line are given* We know that a line is completely determined when we are given two points on it.

Hence, we proceed to find the slope of a line in terms of the coordinates of two points on the line.

Let P(*x* 1 , *y* 1 ) and Q(*x* 2 , *y* 2 ) be two points on non-vertical line *l* whose inclination is θ. Obviously, *x* 1 ≠ *x* 2 , otherwise the line will become perpendicular to *x*-axis and its slope will not be defined. The inclination of the line *l* may be acute or obtuse. Let us take these two cases.

Draw perpendicular QR to *x*-axis and PM perpendicular to RQ as shown in Figs. 9.3 (i) and (ii).

**Case 1** When angle θ is acute:

Therefore, slope of line *l* = *m* = tan θ.

But in $\Delta$MPQ, we have $\tan\theta$=$\frac{\text{MQ}}{\text{MP}}$=$\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. (2)

![](_page_2_Figure_16.jpeg)

![](_page_2_Figure_17.jpeg)

From equations (1) and (2), we have

![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg)

$m=\tan\theta$  
  
$=\tan\left(\ 180^{\circ}-\angle\text{MPQ}\right)=-\tan\ \angle\text{MPQ}$  
  
$=-\frac{\text{MQ}}{\text{MP}}=-\frac{\text{y}_{2}-\text{y}_{1}}{\text{x}_{1}-\text{x}_{2}}=\frac{\text{y}_{2}-\text{y}_{1}}{\text{x}_{2}-\text{x}_{1}}$

Consequently, we see that in both the cases the slope *m* of the line through the points

.

$(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$ is given by $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$.  
  

**9.2.2** *Conditions for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines in terms of their slopes* In a coordinate plane, suppose that non-vertical *lines l*1 and *l*2 have slopes *m*1 *and m*2 *,* respectively. Let their inclinations be α and β, respectively.

**If the line** *l* **1 is parallel to** *l* **2** (Fig 9.4), then their inclinations are equal, i.e.,

$\alpha=\beta$, and hence, $\tan\alpha=\tan\beta$  
  
Therefore $m_{1}=m_{2}$, i.e., their slopes are equal. Conversely, if the slope of two lines $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$ is same, i.e.,

is same, i.e.,

$$m_{\mathrm{{}_{1}}}=m_{\mathrm{{}_{2}}}.$$

![](_page_3_Figure_11.jpeg)

![](_page_3_Figure_12.jpeg)

Then tan α = tan β.

By the property of tangent function (between 0° and 180°), α = β. Therefore, the lines are parallel.

*Hence, two non vertical lines l*1 *and l*2  *are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.*

**If the lines** *l***1 and** *l* **2 are perpendicular** (Fig 9.5), then β = α + 90°*.* Therefore, tan β = tan (α + 90°)

*m*2

= – 1.

$$=-\cot\alpha=-{\frac{1}{\tan\alpha}}$$

i.e., *m*2

Conversely, if *m*1 *m*2 = – 1, i.e., tan α tan β = – 1. Then tan α = – cot β = tan (β + 90°) or tan (β – 90°) Therefore, α and β differ by 90°.

− or *m*1

![](_page_4_Figure_6.jpeg)

Thus, lines *l*1 and *l* 2 are perpendicular to each other.

Hence, *two non-vertical lines are perpendicular to each other if and only if their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other,*

= – 1

$$\mathrm{i.e.,}\qquad\qquad m_{2}=-\,\frac{1}{m_{1}}\,\,\mathrm{or,}\,\,\,m_{1}\,\,m_{2}$$

=

Let us consider the following example.

**Example 1** Find the slope of the lines:

- (a) Passing through the points (3, 2) and (–1, 4),
- (b) Passing through the points (3, 2) and (7, 2),
- (c) Passing through the points (3, 2) and (3, 4),
- (d) Making inclination of 60° with the positive direction of *x*-axis.

**Solution** (a) The slope of the line through (3, – 2) and (– 1, 4) is

$$m=\frac{4-(-2)}{-1-3}=\frac{6}{-4}=-\frac{3}{2}\ .$$

- (b) The slope of the line through the points (3, 2) and (7, 2) is

$$m=\frac{-2-(-2)}{7-3}=\frac{0}{4}=0\,.$$

- (c) The slope of the line through the points (3, 2) and (3, 4) is
$m=\frac{4-(-2)}{3-3}=\frac{6}{0}$, which is not defined.  
  

(d) Here inclination of the line α = 60°. Therefore, slope of the line is *m* = tan 60° = 3 .

**9.2.3** *Angle between two lines* When we think about more than one line in a plane, then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the angle between two lines in terms of their slopes.

Let L1 and L2 be two non-vertical lines with slopes *m*1 and *m*2 ,respectively. If α1 and α2 are the inclinations of lines L1 and L2 , respectively. Then

$m_{1}=\tan a_{1}$ and $m_{2}=\tan a_{2}$

We know that when two lines intersect each other, they make two pairs of vertically opposite angles such that sum of any two adjacent angles is 180°. Let θ and φ be the adjacent angles between the lines L1 and L2 (Fig 9.6). Then

$\theta=\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}+90^{\circ}$.  
  

Therefore tan θ = tan (α2 – α1 ) 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 tan tan 1 tan tan 1 *m m m m* α α α α − − = = + + (as 1 + *m*1*m*2 ≠ 0)

and φ = 180° – θ so that

$\tan\ \phi=\tan\ (180^{\circ}-\theta)=-\tan\ \theta=-\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{1+m_{1}m_{2}}\,,$ as $1\ +m_{1}m_{2}\neq0$

![](_page_5_Figure_11.jpeg)

Now, there arise two cases:

... (1)

*,*

**Case I** If 2 1 1 1 2 *m m– + m m* is positive, then tan θ will be positive and tan φ will be negative,

which means θ will be acute and φ will be obtuse.

**Case II** If 2 1 1 1 2 *m m– + m m* is negative, then tan θ will be negative and tan φ will be positive,

which means that θ will be obtuse and φ will be acute.

Thus, the acute angle (say θ) between lines L1 and L2 with slopes *m*1 and *m*2 , respectively, is given by

$$\tan\theta=\left|\begin{array}{c}{{m_{2}-m_{1}}}\\ {{1+m_{1}m_{2}}}\end{array}\right|,\ \ \mbox{as}\ \ \ 1+m_{1}m_{2}\neq0$$

The obtuse angle (say φ) can be found by using φ =1800 – θ*.*

**Example 2** If the angle between two lines is π 4 and slope of one of the lines is 1 2 , find

the slope of the other line.

**Solution** We know that the acute angle θ between two lines with slopes *m*1 and *m*2

is given by  
  

$$\tan\theta=\left|\begin{array}{c}\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{1+m_{1}m_{2}}\\ \end{array}\right|$$
... (1)  
  
Let $m_{1}=\frac{1}{2}$, $m_{2}=m$ and $\dot{\theta}=\frac{\pi}{4}$.  
  

Now, putting these values in (1), we get

$$\tan\frac{\pi}{4}=\left|\begin{array}{c}m-\frac{1}{2}\\ 1+\frac{1}{2}m\end{array}\right|\quad\mbox{or}\;\;1=\left|\begin{array}{c}m-\frac{1}{2}\\ 1+\frac{1}{2}m\end{array}\right|$$
  
  
which gives  
  

$$\frac{m-\frac{1}{2}}{1+\frac{1}{2}}=1\quad\mbox{or}\quad\frac{m-\frac{1}{2}}{1+\frac{1}{2}}=-1.$$

## **9.3 Various Forms of the Equation of a Line**

We know that every line in a plane contains infinitely many points on it. This relationship between line and points leads us to find the solution of the following problem:

How can we say that a given point lies on the given line? Its answer may be that for a given line we should have a definite condition on the points lying on the line. Suppose P (*x, y*) is an arbitrary point in the XY-plane and L is the given line. For the equation of L, we wish to construct a *statement* or *condition* for the point P that is true, when P is on L, otherwise false. Of course the statement is merely an algebraic equation involving the variables *x* and *y*. Now, we will discuss the equation of a line under different conditions.

**9.3.1** *Horizontal and vertical lines* If a horizontal line L is at a distance *a* from the *x*axis then ordinate of every point lying on the line is either *a* or – *a* [Fig 9.8 (a)]*.* Therefore, equation of the line L is either *y* = *a* or *y =* – *a*. Choice of sign will depend upon the position of the line according as the line is above or below the *y*-axis. Similarly, the equation of a vertical line at a distance *b* from the *y*-axis is either *x* = *b* or *x* = – *b* [Fig 9.8(b)].

![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Example 4** Find the equations of the lines parallel to axes and passing through (– 2, 3).

**Solution** Position of the lines is shown in the Fig 9.9. The *y-*coordinate of every point on the line parallel to *x-*axis is 3, therefore, equation of the line parallel to*x-*axis and passing through (– 2, 3) is *y* = 3. Similarly, equation of the line parallel to *y*-axis and passing through (– 2, 3) is *x* = – 2.

**9.3.2** *Point-slope form* Suppose that P0 (*x*0 *, y*0 ) is a fixed point on a non-vertical line L, whose slope is *m*. Let P (*x, y*) be an arbitrary point on L (Fig 9.10).

Then, by the definition, the slope of L is given by

$m=\frac{V-V_{0}}{x-x_{0}}$, i.e., $y-y_{0}=m(x-x_{0})$

Since the point P0 (*x*0 *, y*0 ) along with all points (*x, y*) on L satisfies (1) and no other point in the plane satisfies (1). Equation (1) is indeed the equation for the given line L.

Thus, the point (*x, y*) lies on the line with slope *m* through the fixed point (*x*0 *, y*0 ), if and only if, its coordinates satisfy the equation

$$y-y_{0}=m\ (x-x_{0})$$

**Example 5** Find the equation of the line through (– 2, 3) with slope – 4.

**Solution** Here *m* = – 4 and given point (*x*0 *, y*0 ) is (– 2, 3).

By slope-intercept form formula (1) above, equation of the given line is

*y* – 3 = – 4 (*x* + 2) or 4*x* + *y* + 5 = 0, which is the required equation.

**9.3.3** *Two-point form* Let the line L passes through two given points P1 (*x*1 *, y*1 ) and P2 (*x*2 *, y*2 ). Let P (*x, y*) be a general point on L (Fig 9.11).

The three points P1 , P2 and P are collinear, therefore, we have slope of P1 P = slope of P1 P2

i.e., $\frac{y-y_{1}}{x-x_{1}}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$, or $y-y_{1}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}(x-x_{1})$.  
  

Thus, equation of the line passing through the points (*x*1 *, y*1 ) and (*x*2 *, y*2 ) is given by

$$y-y_{1}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}(x-x_{1})\tag{2}$$

**Example 6** Write the equation of the line through the points (1, –1) and (3, 5).

**Solution** Here *x*1 = 1, *y*1 = – 1, *x*2 = 3 and *y*2 = 5. Using two-point form (2) above for the equation of the line, we have

$$y-\left(-1\right)=\frac{5-\left(-1\right)}{3-1}\left(x-1\right)$$

or –3*x* + *y* + 4 = 0, which is the required equation.

**9.3.4** *Slope-intercept form* Sometimes a line is known to us with its slope and an intercept on one of the axes. We will now find equations of such lines.

![](_page_10_Figure_19.jpeg)

**Case I** Suppose a line L with slope *m* cuts the *y*-axis at a distance *c* from the origin (Fig 9.12). The distance *c* is called the *yintercept* of the line L. Obviously, coordinates of the point where the line meet the *y*-axis are (0, *c*). Thus, L has slope *m* and passes through a fixed point (0, *c*). Therefore, by point-slope form, the equation of L is

![](_page_11_Figure_2.jpeg)

$$y-c=m\left(x-0\right)\ \ \mathrm{or}\ \ y=m x+c$$

Thus, the point (*x, y*) on the line with slope *m* and *y*-intercept *c* lies on the line if and only if

*y = mx +c ..*.(3)

Note that the value of *c* will be positive or negative according as the intercept is made on the positive or negative side of the *y*-axis, respectively.

**Case II** Suppose line L with slope *m* makes *x-*intercept *d*. Then equation of L is *y = m(x – d)* ... (4)

Students may derive this equation themselves by the same method as in Case I.

**Example 7** Write the equation of the lines for which tan θ = 2 1 , where θ is the

inclination of the line and (i) *y-*intercept is 3 2 *–* (ii) *x*-intercept is 4.

**Solution** (i) Here, slope of the line is *m* = tan θ = 2 1 and *y* - intercept *c* = – 2 3 .

Therefore, by slope-intercept form (3) above, the equation of the line is

$$y=\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{3}{2}\,\,\,\mathrm{or}\,\,\,2y-x+3=0\,,$$

which is the required equation.

(ii) Here, we have $m=\tan\theta=\frac{1}{2}$ and $d=4$.  
  

Therefore, by slope-intercept form (4) above, the equation of the line is

$$y=\frac{1}{2}(x-4)\ \mathrm{or}\ 2y-x+4=0\,,$$

which is the required equation.

**9.3.5** *Intercept - form* Suppose a line L makes *x*-intercept *a* and *y*-intercept *b* on the axes. Obviously L meets *x*-axis at the point (*a*, 0) and *y*-axis at the point (0, *b*) (Fig .9.13). By two-point form of the equation of the line, we have 0 0 ( ) or 0 *b y x a ay bx ab a* − − = − = − + − , i.e., =+ 1 *b y a x* . Thus, equation of the line making intercepts *a* and *b* on *x-*and *y*-axis, respectively, is =+ 1 *b y a x* ... (5) **Fig 9.13**

**Example 8** Find the equation of the line, which makes intercepts –3 and 2 on the *x-* and *y*-axes respectively.

**Solution** Here *a* = –3 and *b* = 2. By intercept form (5) above, equation of the line is

$\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{Fig1}\end{array}$

Any equation of the form A*x +* B*y +* C *=* 0, where A and B are not zero simultaneously is called *general linear equation* or *general equation of a line*.

# **9.4 Distance of a Point From a Line**

The distance of a point from a line is the length of the perpendicular drawn from the point to the line. Let L : A*x* + By + C *=* 0 be a line, whose distance from the point P (*x*1 , *y*1 ) is *d.* Draw a perpendicular PM from the point P to the line L (Fig 9.14). If the

![](_page_14_Figure_1.jpeg)

line meets the *x-*and *y-*axes at the points Q and R, respectively. Then, coordinates of the points are Q C 0 A *,* − and R C 0 B *,* − . Thus, the area of the triangle PQR is given by

area (APQR) = $\frac{1}{2}$PM.QR$\frac{\cdot}{\cdot}$which gives PM = $\frac{2}{\text{area(APQR)}}$... (1)  
  
Also, area (APQR) = $\frac{1}{2}$[x$\frac{\cdot}{\text{B}}$) + (-$\frac{\cdot}{\text{C}}$) (-$\frac{\cdot}{\text{B}}$ - $y_{1}$) + 0 ($y_{1}-0$)]  
  
or 2 area (APQR) = $\frac{\cdot}{\text{AB}}$[x${}_{1}$+By${}_{1}$+C], and 

$\rm{QR}=\sqrt{\left(0+\frac{C}{A}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{C}{B}\right.}-\left.0\right)^{2}=\left|\frac{C}{AB}\right|\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}$

Substituting the values of area (∆PQR) and QR in (1), we get

$$\mathrm{PM}={\frac{\left|\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{A}x_{1}+\mathrm{B}y_{1}+\mathrm{C}}\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2}+\mathrm{B}^{2}}}}$$

or

$$d={\frac{\left\lfloor\mathbf{\Delta}X_{1}+\mathbf{B}y_{1}+\mathbf{C}\right\rfloor}{\sqrt{\mathbf{A}^{2}+\mathbf{B}^{2}}}}\,.$$

Thus, the perpendicular distance (*d*) of a line A*x +* B*y+* C *=* 0 from a point (*x*1 , *y*1 ) is given by

$$d={\frac{\left\lfloor\mathrm{\bf~A}x_{1}+\mathrm{\bf~B}y_{1}+\mathrm{\bf~C}\right\rfloor}{\sqrt{\mathrm{\bf~A}^{2}+\mathrm{\bf~B}^{2}}}}\,.$$

**9.4.1** *Distance between two*

*parallel lines* We know that slopes of two parallel lines are equal. Therefore, two parallel lines can be taken in the form

> *y* = *mx* + *c*1 ... (1)

and *y* = *mx* + *c* 2 ... (2)

Line (1) will intersect *x-*axis at the point

$\left(\frac{C_{1}}{m},\ 0\right)$as shown in Fig 9.15.  
  

**Fig 9.15**

Distance between two lines is equal to the length of the perpendicular from point A to line (2). Therefore, distance between the lines (1) and (2) is

$\left(-m\right)\left(\frac{c_{1}}{m}\right)+\left(-c_{2}\right)$  
  
$\left(\frac{c_{1}}{m}\right)+\left(-c_{2}\right)$  

Thus, the distance *d* between two parallel lines 1 *y mx c* = + and 2 *y mx c* = + is given by

$$d{=}\frac{\left\lfloor\ c_{1}-c_{2}\ \right\rfloor}{\sqrt{\ 1+m^{2}\ }}\ .$$

If lines are given in general form, i.e., A*x* + B*y* + C1 = 0 and A*x* + B*y* + C2 = 0, then above formula will take the form 1 2 2 2 C C A B *d* − = +

Students can derive it themselves.

**Example 9** Find the distance of the point (3, – 5) from the line 3*x* – 4*y* –26 = 0. **Solution** Given line is 3*x* – 4*y* –26 = 0 ... (1)

Comparing (1) with general equation of line A*x* + B*y* + C = 0, we get

$$\mathrm{A=3,\,B=-\,4\,\,and\,\,C=-\,26.}$$

Given point is (*x*1 , *y*1 ) = (3, –5). The distance of the given point from given line is

$$d=\frac{\left|\begin{array}{c}\text{Ax}_{1}+\text{By}_{1}+\text{C}\\ \hline\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{\text{A}^{2}+\text{B}^{2}}}=\frac{\left|\begin{array}{c}3.3+(-4)(-5)-26\\ \hline\end{array}\right|}{\sqrt{\text{3}^{2}+\left(-4\right)^{2}}}=\frac{3}{5}.$$

**Example 10** Find the distance between the parallel lines 3*x* – 4*y* +7 = 0 and

$$3x-4y+5=0$$

**Solution** Here A = 3, B = –4, C1 = 7 and C2 = 5. Therefore, the required distance is

## *Miscellaneous Examples*

**Example 11** If the lines 2 3 0 5 3 0 *x y , x ky* + − = + − = and 3 2 0 *x y* − − = are concurrent, find the value of *k*.

**Solution** Three lines are said to be concurrent, if they pass through a common point, i.e., point of intersection of any two lines lies on the third line. Here given lines are

$$2x+y=3=0^{7}$$

$$\begin{array}{l}\mbox{\chi}+\mbox{\chi}-3=0\\ \end{array}$$

$$\left(\begin{array}{cccc}3x-y-2=0&\end{array}\right)$$

Solving (1) and (3) by cross-multiplication method, we get

$${\frac{x}{-2-3}}={\frac{y}{-9+4}}={\frac{1}{-2-3}}\quad{\mathrm{or}}\quad x=1,\;y=1\;.$$

Therefore, the point of intersection of two lines is (1, 1). Since above three lines are concurrent, the point (1, 1) will satisfy equation (2) so that

$$5.1+k\;.1-3=0{\mathrm{~or~}}k=-\;2.$$

**Example 12** Find the distance of the line 4*x – y =* 0 from the point P (4, 1) measured along the line making an angle of 135° with the positive *x-*axis.

**Solution** Given line is 4*x – y =* 0 ... (1) In order to find the distance of the line (1) from the point P (4, 1) along another line, we have to find the point of intersection of both the lines. For this purpose, we will first find the equation of the second line (Fig 9.16). Slope of second line is tan 135° = *–*1. Equation of the line with slope – 1 through the point P (4, 1) is *y* – 1 = – 1 (*x* – 4) or *x* + *y* – 5 = 0 ... (2) **Fig 9.16 (1, 4)**

Solving (1) and (2), we get *x* = 1 and *y* = 4 so that point of intersection of the two lines is Q (1, 4). Now, distance of line (1) from the point P (4, 1) along the line (2) = the distance between the points P (4, 1) and Q (1, 4).

$\sqrt{(1-4)^{2}+(4-1)^{2}}=3\sqrt{2}$ units.  
  

**Example 13** Assuming that straight lines work as the plane mirror for a point, find the image of the point (1, 2) in the line *x –* 3*y +* 4 = 0.

**Solution** Let Q (*h*, *k*) is the image of the point P (1, 2) in the line

$x-3y+4=0$

Therefore, the line (1) is the perpendicular bisector of line segment PQ (Fig 9.17).

![](_page_18_Figure_9.jpeg)

Hence Slope of line PQ = 1 Slope of line 3 4 0 *x y* − − + = ,

so that $\frac{k-2}{h-1}=\frac{-1}{1}$ or $3h+k=5$... (2)

and the mid-point of PQ, i.e., point ++ 2 2 , 2 1 *kh* will satisfy the equation (1) so that

$$\frac{h+1}{2}-3\Bigg{(}\frac{k+2}{2}\Bigg{)}+4=0\,\,\,\mbox{or}\,\,\,h-3k=-3\tag{3}$$

Solving (2) and (3), we get *h* = 5 6 and *k* = 5 7 .

Hence, the image of the point (1, 2) in the line (1) is 6 7 5 5 *,* .

**Example 14** Show that the area of the triangle formed by the lines

$y=m_{1}x+c_{1}$, $y=m_{2}x+c_{2}$, and $x=0$ is $\frac{\left(c_{1}-c_{2}\right)^{2}}{2\left|m_{1}-m_{2}\right|}$.  
  

**Solution** Given lines are

1

*y* = *m*1 *x* + *c*1 ... (1) *y* = *m*2 *x* + *c* 2 ... (2) *x* = 0 ... (3)

We know that line *y = mx + c* meets the line *x* = 0 (*y*-axis) at the point (0, *c*). Therefore, two vertices of the triangle formed by lines (1) to (3) are P (0, *c* ) and Q (0, *c* ) (Fig 9.18).

Third vertex can be obtained by solving equations (1) and (2). Solving (1) and (2), we get

2

![](_page_19_Figure_13.jpeg)

**Fig 9.18**

$$x=\frac{\left(c_{2}-c_{1}\right)}{\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\right)}\ \ \ \text{and}\ y=\frac{\left(m_{1}c_{2}-m_{2}c_{1}\right)}{\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\right)}$$
  
  
Therefore, third vertex of the triangle is $\text{R}\left(\frac{\left(c_{2}-c_{1}\right)}{\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\right)}\,\ \frac{\left(m_{1}c_{2}-m_{2}c_{1}\right)}{\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\right)}\right)$.  
  

Now, the area of the triangle is

$$=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{|}\ 0\ \left(\frac{m_{1}c_{2}-m_{2}c_{1}}{m_{1}-m_{2}}-c_{2}\right)+\frac{c_{2}-c_{1}}{m_{1}-m_{2}}\big{(}c_{2}-c_{1}\big{)}+0\ \left(c_{1}-\frac{m_{1}c_{2}-m_{2}c_{1}}{m_{1}-m_{2}}\right)\Bigg{|}=\frac{\left(c_{2}-c_{1}\right)^{2}}{2\Big{|}m_{1}-m_{2}\Big{|}}$$

**Example 15** A line is such that its segment between the lines

5*x* – *y* + 4 = 0 and 3*x* + 4*y* – 4 = 0 is bisected at the point (1, 5). Obtain its equation.

**Solution** Given lines are

$\begin{array}{l}\mbox{\rm S}x-y+4=0\\ \mbox{\rm S}x+4y-4=0\end{array}$

Let the required line intersects the lines (1) and (2) at the points, (α1 , β1 ) and (α2 , β2 ), respectively (Fig 9.19). Therefore

$$\begin{array}{l}{{5\alpha_{1}-\beta_{1}+4=0\mathrm{~and~}}}\\ {{3\;\alpha_{2}+4\;\beta_{2}-4\,{\overset{\rightharpoonup}{=}}\,0}}\end{array}$$

or

or $\beta_{1}=5a_{1}+4$ and $\beta_{2}=4-3a_{2}$

We are given that the mid point of the segment of the required line between (α1 , β1 ) and (α2 , β2 ) is (1, 5). Therefore **Fig 9.19**

$$\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=2\ \ \text{and}\ \ \frac{5\alpha_{1}+4+\frac{4-3\alpha_{2}}{4}}{2}=5,$$
  
  
or $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=2$ and $20\alpha_{1}-3\alpha_{2}=20$... (3)

Solving equations in (3) for α1 and α2 , we get

$\alpha_{1}=\frac{26}{23}$ and $\alpha_{2}=\frac{20}{23}$ and hence, $\beta_{1}=5.\frac{26}{23}+4=\frac{222}{23}$.  
  

Equation of the required line passing through (1, 5) and (α1 , β1 ) is

$$y-5={\frac{\beta_{1}-5}{a_{1}-1}}(x-1)\,{\mathrm{or}}\,\,\,y-5={\frac{\frac{222}{23}-5}{\frac{26}{23}-1}}(x-1)$$

or 107*x* – 3*y* – 92 = 0,

which is the equation of required line.

**Example 16** Show that the path of a moving point such that its distances from two lines 3*x* – 2*y* = 5 and 3*x* + 2*y* = 5 are equal is a straight line.

**Solution** Given lines are

$$3x-2y=5$$
  
  
and  
  

$$3x+2y=5$$
  
  
... (1)  
  
... (2)

Let (*h, k*) is any point, whose distances from the lines (1) and (2) are equal. Therefore

$$\frac{|3h-2k-5|}{\sqrt{9+4}}=\frac{|3h+2k-5|}{\sqrt{9+4}}\text{or}|3h-2k-5|=|3h+2k-5|\,,$$

which gives 3*h* – 2*k* – 5 = 3*h* + 2*k* – 5 or – (3*h* – 2*k* – 5) = 3*h* + 2*k* – 5.

Solving these two relations we get *k* = 0 or *h* = 3 5 . Thus, the point (*h*, *k*) satisfies the

equations *y* = 0 or *x* = 3 5 , which represent straight lines. Hence, path of the point equidistant from the lines (1) and (2) is a straight line.
