It is now being increasingly realised that sports contribute to the physical, psychological and emotional well-being of an individual. Sports play a significant role in healthy social development and interaction. It helps people learn how to set and achieve goals through discipline and hard work. It nurtures the development of decision-making and leadership abilities, while teaching people to manage both success and failure. Today, it has become one of the most popular activities being organised at regular intervals. In it's true sense, *sports means much more than* just to compete in a few events organised at certain intervals for the highest honour of one's state/country.

Sports is a human activity that contributes to the holistic development of individuals. It is recognised as an individual activity which offers the opportunity for self-knowledge, selfexpression and fulfilment of personal achievement; skill acquisition and demonstration of ability; enjoyment, good health and well-being. Sports also engages us in a collective effort to pursue human excellence. It provides us an opportunity for social interaction. It is a source of pleasure, but more than that, sports inspires, brings cultures together, and can bridge social divides. Sports can enrich society and foster friendships between nations. Sports is also responsible for the application of rules and for adherence to values such as mutual respect, solidarity and fair play.

Sports today, faces the pressures of modern society and new challenges. When sports events like Olympic games, Common-Wealth Games, Asian Games or those related to Cricket, Football, Volleyball, Tennis, Hockey or Badminton take place, millions of spectators, viewers on television, internet or listeners on radio become intensely engaged even though a selected few participate.

Sports is primarily a competitive activity where winning is the be all and end all. Do you agree with this statement? Perhaps that is why, in this highly competitive sports environment, we quite often hear about unethical behaviour which includes cheating, bending the rules, doping, abuse of food additives, physical and verbal violence, harassment, sexual abuse and trafficking of young sportspersons, discrimination, exploitation, unequal opportunities, unethical sports practices, unfair

means, excessive commercialisation, use of drugs in sports and corruption.

These are just a few examples of what may go wrong with sports. There is not just one reason for these, part of the problem is that people ignore ethics while making decisions. It is in this context that ethics occupy a critical place. In the present chapter we shall discuss various dimensions of sports ethics.

## **8.2 What is Sports Ethics?**

Before discussing various dimensions of sports ethics, it is important to understand the meaning of ethics. Ethics, morals and values are used interchangeably in everyday language, though these terms are not synonyms. The concept of ethics is technically understood as a branch of philosophy that defines what is good for the individual and society and establishes the nature of obligations, or duties, that people owe themselves and to one another. But without going into the complexities of this concept, it is relevant to understand ethics as the practice of making principled choices between right and wrong: a code of conduct that guides human behaviour, a set of standards that guides our conduct. It is generally viewed as the system or set of rules, norms or laws by which attitudes and actions are determined to be either "right or wrong". The fundamental problem of ethics is determining what constitutes proper conduct. It defines how individuals, professionals in different fields, organisations, associations, federation and corporations choose to interact with one another.

In view of the above, sports ethics is a positive concept that guides human action in sports. It is defined as the code of conduct for promoting and ensuring healthy sporting practices. Sports ethics signifies not just a certain form of behaviour but also a particular way of thinking. It promotes fair play among children and young persons via educational and preventive measures and encourages the dissemination of good practices to promote diversity in sport and combat all forms of discrimination.

Every child and young person has the right to play sport and games to gain satisfaction from the experience. The code of sports ethics applies to all levels of skills and commitment, recreational activities as well as competitive sport. It involves the elimination of all types of negative behaviour on and off the field. More importantly, it promotes equity and sporting excellence.

Sports ethics is also focused on equity in sport which should be an expression of human excellence. It has two dimensions:

## **Box 8.1**

Ethics is much more than playing within the rules, as it covers notions such as friendship, respect for others and the sporting spirit.

## **Box 8.2**

Institutions and adults must be the guarantors of the right to play sport and games.

Chapter-8 Ethics in sports.indd 110 18-11-2016 4:42:29 PM

- **(a) Institutional:** Discrimination based on criteria other than performance must be rejected, rules must be applied uniformly and without resorting to arbitrary decisions;
- **(b) Personal:** There is a moral obligation to abide by the rules, in accordance with the principles of fair play. It tries to ensure that sporting excellence must be an expression of human excellence and performance and results should emerge from the deserved and meritorious development of individual talent. The codes of sports ethics documented by the Olympic Committee and other international and national sports bodies, governments, sports federations and associations, sports sponsoring

## **Activity 8.1**

- • Gather information from the literature on sports regarding the codes of sports ethics developed, documented and issued by various sports bodies at global and regional levels.
- • Collect such codes of sports ethics documented by government and sports bodies in India.

concerns and specialised research institutions provide a comprehensive view of sports ethics. These clearly suggest that sports ethics is a set of standards that guide the conduct of all concerned with sports — the sports persons, trainers, referees, managers, administrators, parents, teachers, journalists, doctors and pharmacists, nutritional expert, sports sponsoring concerns, top level sportspersons who serve as models and even spectators. These ethical standards are universal and objective and are not based on subjective guidelines. They have been proven over time.

# **8.3 Sports Ethics: Standards**

What are sport ethics or standards? Commonly described as six pillars of fair play, Standards are integral elements of all sports activities, sports policy and management, and apply to all levels of ability and commitment, including recreational as well as competitive sports. These are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship.

#### **8.3.1 Trustworthiness**

- • Always pursue victory with honour.
- • Demonstrate and demand integrity.
- • Observe and enforce the spirit and letter of the rules.
- • Do not engage in or tolerate dishonesty, cheating, or dishonourable conduct.

#### **8.3.2 Respect**

- • Treat the traditions of the sports and other participants with respect.

- • Win with grace and lose with dignity.

## **8.3.3 Responsibility**

- • Be a positive role model on and off the field.
- • Safeguard your health. Know what you're putting in your body. Just because a substance is legal or natural doesn't mean it's permitted or safe in health context.

## **8.3.6 Citizenship**

- • Play by the rules. Sports is defined by the rules. These rules may be yours or your team's or your teacher's.
- • Follow the spirit of the rules. Resist the temptation of gaining an advantage by bending the rules. Take pride in your performance while abiding by the rules. You have worked too hard to throw it away by cheating.
- • As a member of a community, whether in a team, in a classroom, or with a family, think how your choices impact other community members.

## **8.4 Responsibility for Observance of Sports Ethics**

The responsibility to ensure observance of sports ethics belongs to all those who are directly or indirectly, associated with sports and especially those who influence and encourage the involvement and participation in sports. These include:

- • Governments at all levels, including the agencies working with governments.

The intent of this exercise is not to tell you what is right or wrong. These are just a few examples of ethical choices that sports provide. Out of the four options against each example, tick one out of four choices. Remember, it is important for you to decide what you will do when faced with these choices. Be proactive by setting your standards before you get to the heat of the competition.

| 3. | At a crucial point in a big game, |  |  |  |  |
|  | a player fakes an injury to get a |  |  |  |  |
|  | needed time-out for the team. |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | In tennis, the ball is called out |  |  |  |  |
|  | though the player is certain it hit |  |  |  |  |
|  | the line. The player says nothing |  |  |  |  |
|  | and takes the point. |  |  |  |  |
| 5. | There is a loud appeal for caught |  |  |  |  |
|  | behind, which was denied by |  |  |  |  |
|  | the umpire. But the batsman |  |  |  |  |
|  | goes back to pavilion, as he/she |  |  |  |  |
|  | knows his/her bat had touched |  |  |  |  |
|  | the ball. |  |  |  |  |

| --- | --- |
|  | personal insults while coaching. |
| 7. | In soccer, the best player on |
|  | the other team already has a |

|  | deliberately fake a foul hopping |
|  | that player will be given a red card |
|  | and removed from the game. |
| 8. | The team captain argues with |
