# **Team Games**

Any game which provides opportunities to two or more players working together towards a shared objective is called a team game. A team game is an activity in which individuals are organised in a team to compete with the opposing team, in accordance with a set of laws/rules to win. Games like Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Volleyball, etc., are some of the classic examples of major team games.

However, over a period of time, the popularity of team games has grown continuously. These games have positively influenced not just the players, but also their fans, local and national economies. All over the world, the impact of team games can be seen resulting in professional players to live out their dreams. Star players have become role models to youth. Young athletes/players develop life skills which are followed as footsteps of their role models.

In this chapter, some of the team games like Basketball, Cricket, Football, Handball, Hockey, Kabaddi, Kho-Kho, and Volleyball are explained.

# **Basketball**

Basketball is a team game played between two teams of five players each, on the court. Very high amount of energy (calories) expenditure is there in this game. It also helps in building bone and muscle strength and boosts the immune system. This game also develops self-discipline and concentration among young players.

# **History**

Basketball originated in the United States of America and was invented by Dr. James Naismith in December, 1891, who was a Physical Educator at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) (now known

as Springfield College of Physical Education) in Springfield, Massachusetts.

#### **Do You Know?**

On January 15 1892, the first set of rules of the Basketball game were published by Dr. James Naismith in the college magazine, "*Triangle*", under the title "A New Game".

![](_page_1_Picture_4.jpeg)

*Fig. 5.1: Dr. James Naismith*

Naismith sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness. But after rejecting many ideas, he obtained a soccer ball and two wooden peach baskets. He hung the baskets on the railing of the balcony at the height of 10 ft above the floor at the opposite ends of the gym hall. The objective of the game was to toss the soccer ball into the peach baskets. The first basketball game was played among physical education students with nine players on each side, of Springfield secretarial training class of Physical Education (PE) College in December, 1891.

The International Basketball Federation FIBA (French acronym: Federation Internationale de Basketball) association was founded in Geneva in 1932. Basketball was featured in the St. Louis, Missouri, United States, III Olympic Games in 1904. It was officially recognised as an Olympic game in 1936 in Berlin. Due to the wide popularity, Basketball was played in the first Asian Games in 1951 held at New Delhi.

#### *History of basketball in India*

Basketball was introduced in India by American missionaries towards the end of the first decade of 20th century. It was presumed that in the year 1905, the game of basketball was started at the YMCA Calcutta by H. Peterson and J.N. Guaj. The credit of starting and popularising this game goes to YMCA College of Physical Education, Madras in the year 1920. The first National Basketball Championship was organised in 1934 by the Indian Olympic Association and later after the

Chap-5.indd 130 31-07-2020 15:27:24

constitution of Basketball Federation of India (BFI) in 1950 at Mumbai, the First National Basketball Championship under the banner of BFI was held at Ludhiana (Punjab) in 1951.

#### **Basic Skills of Basketball**

Basketball is played with the help of different skills and techniques like stance, footwork, ball holding and handling, dribbling, passing-receiving, shooting and rebounding. Few are mentioned here.

# *Dribbling*

It is important to move the ball across the court, get away from defensive players, make or find a good passing line, make use of faking action, 1 on 1 and of course to penetrate the ball to score the goal. There are different types of dribbling which may be learnt and developed with the help of different drills in stationary and moving positions with or without the defensive player.

![](_page_9_Figure_10.jpeg)

*Fig. 5.9: Dribbling*

- **•** Stationary dribble
- **•** Low dribble
- **•** High dribble

Chap-5.indd 138 31-07-2020 15:27:26

- **•** Change of pace dribble
- **•** Crossover dribble
- **•** Behind the back dribble
- **•** Between the legs dribble
- **•** Speed dribble
- **•** Reverse spin dribble

# *Passing and Receiving*

A good offensive attack requires accurate passing and receiving. It helps to speed the ball, find an open man, to find a good shooter or to get away the ball from the defender. Fake and feint are used to increase the quality of passing. There are different types of passing using one or both hands during different stationary and moving group and team drills.

- **•** Chest pass
- **•** Overhead pass
- **•** Push pass
- **•** Bounce pass
- **•** Shoulder pass
- **•** Hook pass
- **•** Off the dribble pass
- **•** Baseball pass

![](_page_10_Picture_17.jpeg)

*Fig. 5.10: Passing and receiving*

# *Shooting*

The objective of the game is to win by scoring maximum points. Therefore, improving the team's shooting is important to win a game. Shooting by either one or both hands may be done in the following ways:

- **•** Jump Shot
- **•** Dunk Shot
- **•** Free Throw
- **•** Layup
- **•** Three point shot

![](_page_10_Picture_26.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 139 31-07-2020 15:27:27

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

*Fig. 5.11: Shooting*

# *Rebounding*

The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the ring or backboard. This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebound—offensive rebound, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebound, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebound is defensive, as the team on defence tend to be better positioned to recover the missed shots.

![](_page_11_Picture_5.jpeg)

*Fig. 5.12: Rebounding*

#### *Defence*

The game of basketball allows a variety of defences to be deployed in an effort to disrupt and combat the offensive plays. Here are examples of the three basic categories of team defence. In addition, each category consists of an assortment of different variations.

![](_page_11_Picture_9.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 140 31-07-2020 15:27:28

- **1. Man to man defence:** Man to man defence is usually assigned to be matched up with the defenders against specific offensive players. Defenders are usually assigned to be matched up with the offensive players by size and ability.
- **2. Zone Defence:** In zone defence, defenders are assigned to guard specific areas on the court. Zones are named or designated by their player alignments.

![](_page_12_Picture_3.jpeg)

#### *Fig. 5.13: Zone defence*

- **3. Combined Defence:** The third type of defence that can be deployed is the combination defence. With combination defence, some of the players are assigned to play man to man while the rest of the defenders play zone defence. Combination defences are usually deployed in an effort to stop or neutralise great individual offensive players.
# **Awards in Basketball**

To motivate the extraordinary achievements of the player and coaches, the Government of India honours players with different awards along with cash prizes and certificates.

Prasanthi Singh was honoured with Arjuna Award in 2017 and she is the first basketball player who received the prestigious civilian award Padma Shri in 2018.

# **Cricket**

Playing any game need strength and vice versa helps in building strength. Cricket also, through the constant running across the field, helps in increasing the stamina, balance, hand-eye coordination, flexibility and ball-handling skills. Cricket includes a lot of throwing and sprinting across the field, which is a good cardiovascular activity.

# **History**

A reference of a game resembling to cricket is there in the records of King Edward I, in 1300 being played at Kent. Cricket as a game was first recorded in 16th century in England. Researches show that the game evolved from a very old, widespread game to pass time in which one player served a small piece like a ball made up of wood or any other material and another player hit it with a suitable item. The first recorded cricket match took place in Kent in 1646. Cricket was popular and widely documented in England during the 1700s. After 1760, the game saw the evolution of over arm bowling by replacing under arm bowling. The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was formed on 31st May, 1787. After a year, it laid down a code of laws regarding the game. Its laws were adopted throughout the game. MCC today remains the custodian and arbiter of laws relating to cricket around the world. Thereafter, cricket recognisably became the game that is played today. In the 1800, cricket had reached the West Indies and India and in the 19th century cricket was played in South Africa and New Zealand. The first international cricket game was played between the USA and Canada in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of St George's Cricket Club in New York. In 1877, an England touring team in Australia played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural test matches.

# *History of Cricket in India*

Cricket is undoubtedly one of the most popular games in India since its inception. The first Indian Cricket club, named the Parsee Oriental Cricket Club, was founded in the year 1848 and they played their first match in Bombay (Mumbai). From this point, the journey of Indian cricket began. The first international exposure in the history of Indian Cricket came in the year 1926. In the same year, a team from the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) toured India. Though it was an unofficial tour, Indian people were quite interested and enthusiastic about the matches that MCC played during the tour.

Chap-5.indd 142 31-07-2020 15:27:29

The legendary Indian cricket player, C.K. Naidu played brilliantly during that tour and he also scored a century against the MCC in Bombay. Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC), now International Cricket Council, was formed on 30 November, 1907. At present there are 105 countries as members of ICC. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was established in the year 1928. India played its first test match against England in 1932. Now cricket is played to cover all the three formats, ranging from 5 Day tests, to the exciting one-day 50 over format, and the 20 over format which is called as T20.

*Fig. 5.14: Cricket in the early ages*

# **Functional Rules**

Cricket has many laws, more than any other game. Cricket is played with a bat and ball on a large field, known as ground. It is played between two teams having 11 players each. There is also a reserved player called a 'twelfth player', who is used if any player is injured during the play. The twelfth player is not allowed to bowl, bat, or to act as wicketkeeper or captain of the team. The twelfth player is only to act as a substitute fielder.

The objective of the game is to score runs with the bat by the batsman, or dismiss the opposing batsman when in the field by the bowlers. The cricket laws are for the traditional form of cricket which is called 'Test Cricket'. However, there are separate rules for one day and T20 format game also.

# **Do You Know?**

*Fig. 5.17: Cricket pitch measurements*

There are two ground umpires and a third umpire. Their role is to ensure in the ground that the game is played as per the preambles and laws. The third umpire is in charge of the video decisions.

**Game Structure:** Test cricket is a game that spans for two or more innings. This means that one team needs to bowl and the other would do batting. If a team is out twice or scores less runs in two innings, than that team is the losing team.

Before the game begins, an umpire tosses a coin. The captain who guesses the correct side of the coin will then choose whether to bat or field first.

# **How to play Cricket**

- **•** One team will bat while the other team will field.
- **•** If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place or the ball is either dangerous or bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing at illegal positions, it is called 'No Ball'.

*Fig. 5.18: (a) No ball (b) Wide ball*

The batsman can hit a no ball and score runs and also cannot be declared out from a no ball except if the player is run out or hit the ball twice, or obstruct the field. A no ball will add one run to the batting team.

- **•** A 'Wide Ball' is declared if the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. As if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen's reach. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team.
- **•** A 'Bye' run is scored when a batsman is trying to hit the ball but could not hit it and is miss-field by the fielder or wicket keeper.
- **•** A 'Leg Bye' run is scored if while hitting, the batsman misses to hit the ball by bat and is deflected by striker's body or protective gear.

#### *When is a Batsman declared 'out' as per cricket rules?*

There are 11 ways through which a batsman can be given "out" in the game of cricket.

- **• Bowled:** If the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman's wickets, the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail or stump is dislodged by the ball).
Chap-5.indd 146 31-07-2020 15:27:32

It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman's bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman.

- **• Caught:** If a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball at all with the bat or hand holding the bat and the fielders, or wicket keeper or bowler catches the ball, it is called as caught out.
- **• Stumped:** A batsman can be given out when the wicketkeeper puts down the wicket while the player is out of the crease and not attempting a run (while attempting a run it would be a run out) but trying to play the ball and misses it.

#### **Activity 5.5**

- **•** Draw and discuss the different positions of the fielders in cricket.

- **• Leg Before Wicket (LBW):** If the ball is bowled (not a No Ball) and it hits the batsman first without touching and the bat and umpire thinks and decide that the ball would have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there, then the LBW decision is possible. However, if the ball hits the batsman outside the line of off stump while the player was attempting to play a stroke then the player is not out.
- **• Run Out:** A batsman is out if no part of the bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side.
- **• Hit Wicket:** If a batsman hits the wicket down with the bat or body after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and the ball is in play, then the player is out.
- **• Handled the Ball:** If the batsman willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition, then the player is declared out.

# **Football**

The history of football is over more than 1000 years old. Today, football is world's most favourite sport played in almost every country. Studies reveal about various games similar to the modern football being introduced in different parts of the world by different cultures for different purposes. Oldest version of football game is believed to be played in the villages of Chinese dynasty.

# **History of the Game**

Both rugby and football have a common root. There were many who instead of kicking believed in running with the ball in their hands. Kicking the ball included tripping the legs without any legislation or rules to govern. On the contrary, many people stood for football with kicking as it involved greater mastery of ball. In football, high level of skill precision was required to control and manoeuvre the ball with foot. The rules of play were subsequently smoothed down and smartened to create organised sports at Britain and Scotland. It was at this point that the people spoke out against rough customs as tripping, shin-kicking and so on. As it happened, the majority also expressed disapproval at carrying the ball with hand. It was in 1863 in England that the Rugby football group withdrew and formed a separate branch. This further led to the development modern-day sports of 'Association Football', 'Rugby Football' and 'Gaelic Football' in Ireland. Later the Football Association in England was formed becoming the sports' first governing body. In 1904, 'Federation International de Football Association' (FIFA) was founded in Paris as an international governing body of football. The game of football in today's scenario is called 'Soccer'.

## **Modern football**

Britain is regarded as the home to modern association football. Within Britain and Scotland, the game was popular from eight century and again played with different variations. In medieval times, towns and villages played against the rival towns and villages— and kicking, punching, biting and gouge were allowed. Hundreds of people took part and the games could last all day. It was same until the game started being promoted in schools in England as an integral part of the school curriculum. The need for uniform standards and rules acceptable to everyone was the need of the hour. This led to the role of Cambridge University in unifying the schools and the clubs to a meeting in 1863 for establishing common acceptable rules. Football Association Challenge Cup was started in 1872, which is regarded as the world's oldest football championship. In the year 1888, 'Durand Cup' was started in Shimla (India) and in modern time Durand cup for football is regarded as second oldest football tournament in the world. Later in 1904, FIFA (Federation International de Football Association) was formed with France, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Germany as the founder members.

# **History of Football in India**

Football in India has been a popular sport introduced in nineteenth century by the British army, from the capital at Calcutta. Durand Cup started in 1888, founded by the then India's Foreign Secretary, Mortimer Durand at Shimla. Durand Cup is the third oldest football tournament after Football Association (FA) Cup and Scottish Cup. Clubs like Mohan Bagan, which is the oldest current team, was formed in 1889. Indian Football Association (IFA) Shield is the fourth oldest tournament in the world which was founded in 1893 and is still being played. Durand Cup was shifted to Delhi. Since 1950, every year it is organised under the supervision of Indian Army.

Before the birth of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in 1937, India was lacking a constituted national organisation for football. Since, football gained immense popularity year after year, a need for the proper administration of the game was considered. The association that governed football in West Bengal, Indian Football Association (IFA), was given the status of the de-facto governing body of football. That time all the foreign tours of Indian football team were organised by IFA. AIFF was affiliated to FIFA (international governing body of football) in 1948 and to Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1954. AIFF has played a key role in promoting

Chap-5.indd 150 31-07-2020 15:27:35

football in India. To serve the purpose, it has taken the responsibility of Indian national football team. National Football League (I-League), Federation Cup and National Football Championship for Santosh Trophy are some of the prominent football tournaments being organised by the AIFF.

# **Handball**

#### **History**

At the end of the nineteenth century, somewhere in Northern Europe, it became necessary to unify the rules, which was

![](_page_31_Figure_11.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 160 31-07-2020 15:27:38

done by Karl Schelenz. The new game rules came in force in Berlin, in 1917. The sports international governing body was first formed in 1928 as the Federation International Handball Amateur. It took its current name in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1946 as the International Handball Federation (IHF). The first president of IHF was Avery Brundage—an American who went on to become president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The first Field Handball World Championships were played in Germany in 1938, following its appearance at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and then it made a comeback into the games in the 1972 Munich Olympic games. The women's version of the game was added in the 1976 Montreal Olympic games. Indoor Handball was invented in the 1940s in Denmark. The International Handball Federation which was established in 1946, oversees the game, and at present it has 175 member countries associated with it. The first International Handball Federation (IHF) World Men's Handball Championship commenced in 1954. The IHF World Women's Handball Championship commenced in 1957.

The Asian Handball Federation (AHF) is the governing body of handball in Asia. The Asian Handball Federation had begun when the Martyr Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah of the Kuwait initiated a motion to the Executive Committee of the Asian Games requesting recognition of the handball game and also formation of the Asian Handball Federation during seventh Asian Games, Tehran, Iran in 1974. Accordingly, the Asian Games Federation during its meeting on 26th of August 1974, had recognised Handball as an official game. The headquarters is located in Kuwait City, Kuwait.

The Handball federation of India was established in 1972. The first senior National Handball Championship was held at Rohtak (Haryana) in 1972. Haryana won the gold medal and Vidharbha got the silver medal. First time in India, Handball Team participated in Asian Games held in India in 1982.

| Age Group | Playing time with 10 minutes of interval |
| --- | --- |
| 8–12 years | Two halves of 20 minutes |
| 12–16 years | Two halves of 25 minutes |
| 16 and above | Two halves of 30 minutes |

**Table 4: Duration of the game**

This is running time except for injury or one team timeout. The teams have to change bench/side after half-time. Overtime consists of two halves of 5 minute/period with 1 minute half-time break. If the game is still tied, the winner will be determined in accordance with the rules of the particular competition.

# *Team Time-out*

One minute time-out can be taken by each team in every half.

# *Throw-off*

A throw-off is given to the team that wins the toss. Both the teams must be in their own side of the court with the defense 3 meters away from the ball. On a whistle, the ball is passed from centre court to a teammate and the play begins. Throwoff is repeated after every goal scored and after half-time.

# *Throw-in*

When the ball goes out of bounds on the sideline or when the ball is last touched by a defensive player (not goalkeeper), a throw-in is awarded and goes out of bounds over the endline. The throw-in is taken from the nearest spot where the ball crossed out. The thrower must put either foot on the sideline to perform the throw-in. All opponents must stand 3 meters away from the ball.

# *Scoring*

A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line inside the goal. A goal may be scored from any type of throw, i.e., free-throw, throw-in, throw-off, and goal-throw.

# *Playing the Ball*

A player is permitted to throw, push, stop, catch, or hit the ball, by using hands (open or closed), head, arms, torso, thighs, and knees.

- (a) A player is allowed:
	- (i) to run with the ball for 3 steps.
	- (ii) to hold the ball for 3 seconds.

![](_page_35_Figure_17.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 164 31-07-2020 15:27:40

- (iii) unlimited dribble with 3 steps allowed before and after dribbling (no double-dribble).
- (iv) to take a maximum of 3 steps with the ball.

# *Defending the Opponent*

A player may use the torso of the body to defend an opponent with or without the ball. However, using the outstretched arms or legs to obstruct, push, hold, trip or hit is not allowed. The attacking player is not allowed to charge into a defensive player.

# *Passive Play*

A ball possession team cannot delay the game without making a recognisable attempt to attack and to shoot or goal. Referee Throw: A referee throw is awarded simultaneous infringement of the rules after simultaneous possession of the ball. The referee throws the ball vertically between two opposing players at centre court. The jumping players may tap the ball to a teammate or grab the ball. During this, other players must be 3 meters away from the ball.

### *Free-throw*

Free-throw is awarded to the opponent against a minor foul or violation at the exact spot of the foul. If the foul or violation occurs between the goal area line and the 9 meter line, the throw is taken from the nearest post outside the 9 meter line. The thrower must keep one foot in contact with the floor.

# **A Player is NOT allowed to**

- **•** endanger an opponent with the ball.
- **•** pull, hit or punch the ball out of the hands of an opponent.
- **•** contact the ball below the knee.
- **•** dive on the floor for a rolling or stationary ball.

# *7 Meter Throw*

The 7 meter throw is awarded when:

- **•** Illegally demolish a clear chance to goal
- **•** The goalkeeper carries the ball back into his/her team's own goal area
- **•** A court player intentionally plays the ball to his or her own goalkeeper in the goal area and the goalkeeper touches the ball
- **•** A defensive player enters his or her goal area to gain an advantage over an attacking player in possession of the ball.

- **•** Any player may take the 7 meter throw.

#### *Goal-throw*

When the ball rebounds off the goalkeeper over the end line, a goal-throw is given. The player of the attacking team throws over the ball from the end line. The goalkeeper takes the throw inside the goal area and is not limited by the 3-step/3-second rule.

Progressive Punishments: These pertain to the fouls that require more punishment than just a free-throw. 'Actions' directed mainly at the opponent and not the ball (such as reaching around, holding, pushing, hitting, tripping and jumping into an opponent) are to be punished progressively.

#### *Warnings (Yellow Card)*

The referee gives only one warning to a player for rule violations and a total of three warnings to a team. Exceeding these limits results in 2 minute suspension thereafter. Warning is not required prior to giving 2 minute suspension. 2 minute suspension is awarded to a player for serious or repeated rule violations, like non-sportsmanship conduct, illegal substitution, etc.

## *Disqualification and Exclusion (Red Card)*

A disqualification is equivalent to three 2 minute suspensions. A disqualified player must leave the competition arena. The team has to continue play for rest of the time with one player short due to player's disqualification.

# *Playing Court*

The playing court in Handball is a 40 meter long and 20 meter wide rectangle, consisting of two goalposts. The longer boundary lines are called side lines, and the shorter ones are called goal lines (between the goalposts) or outer goal lines (on either side of the goal). There should be a safety zone surrounding the playing court, with a width of at least 1 meter along the side lines and 2 meters behind the goal lines.

- All lines on the court are fully part of the playing area that they enclose. The goal lines shall be 8 cm wide at the goalposts (see diagram), whereas all the other
![](_page_37_Figure_17.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 166 31-07-2020 15:27:40

lines shall be 5 cm wide. Lines between two adjacent areas may be replaced with a difference in colours between the adjacent areas of the floor.

- In front of each goal, there is a goal area. The goal area is defined by the goal area line (6 meter line), which is drawn with the following dimensions.
	- (a) A 3 meter long line directly in front of the goal; this line is parallel to the goal line and 6 metres away from it (measured from the rear edge of the goal line to the front edge of the goal area line).
	- (b) Two quarter circles, each with a radius of 6 metres (measured from the rear inner corner of the goalposts), connecting the 3 meter long line with the outer goal line.

The free throw line (9 metre line) is a broken line, drawn 3 metres outside the goal area line. Both the segments of the line and the spaces between them measure 15cm (see diagram).

The 7 meter line is a 1 meter long line, directly in front of the goal. It is parallel to the goal line and 7 meters away from it (measured from the rear edge of the goal line to the front edge of the 7 meter line) see diagram.

The goalkeeper's restraining line (the 4 meter line) is a 15cm long line, directly in front of the goal. It is parallel to the goal line and 4 metres away from it (measured from the rear edge of the goal line to the front edge of the 4 meter line). The center line connects the midpoints of the two side lines.

The substitution line (a segment of the side line) for each team extends from the center line to a point at a distance of 4.5 meters from the center line. This end point of the substitution line is enhanced by a line which is parallel to the center line, extending 15cm inside the side line and 15cm outside the side line (see diagrams).

# **Specifications of equipment**

A goal (see diagrams) is placed in the center of each outer goal line. The goals must be firmly attached to the floor or the walls behind them. They have an interior height of 2 metres and a width of 3 metres.

The goalposts are joined by a horizontal crossbar. The rear side of the goalposts shall be in line with the rear edge of the goal line. The goalposts and the crossbar must have an 8cm square cross section. On the three sides which are visible from the court, they must be painted in bands of two contrasting colors, which also contrast clearly with the background. The goals must have a net, that should be attached in such a way that a ball thrown into the goal normally remains in the goal.

# **Hockey**

#### **History**

Historical records indicate that the crude form of hockey was played in Egypt around 4,000 years ago. Evidence also shows that a form of this game was played by Romans and Greeks. The modern game of hockey evolved in England in the mid-eighteenth century, primarily around the schools.

The first Olympic Hockey Competition for men was held in London in 1908. Ireland and Scotland competed separately. After having made its first appearance in 1908 games, hockey was subsequently dropped from the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games. It reappeared in 1920 at Antwerp (Belgium) before being omitted again in Paris in 1924. The Paris organisers refused to include hockey in the Olympics, stating that the sport had no International Federation.

Hockey had made its first step towards an International Federation in 1909 when the Hockey Association in England and the Belgium Hockey Association agreed to recognise each other to regulate international hockey relations. The French Association followed soon after, but this was not considered sufficient to recognise this game at the international level.

#### *Federation International de Hockey (FIH)*

The International Hockey Federation, the world governing body was founded in Paris in 1924, initiated by Paul Leautey, a Frenchman. Paul Leautey became the first President of the FIH.

In many ways, the FIH serves as the 'guardian' of the sport. It works in co-operation with both the national and

![](_page_40_Picture_15.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 169 31-07-2020 15:27:41

continental organisations to ensure consistency and unity in hockey around the world.

The Federation International Hockey (FIH) not only regulates the sport, but is also responsible for its development and promotion so as to guarantee a secure future for hockey.

FIH comprises a network of five continental federations (CHFS), 12 National associations (NHAS), an executive board and 7 expert advisory committees, with a Head Office in Brussels. The FIH retains overall responsibility for hockey worldwide, including the rules of hockey, umpiring and coaching.

Chap-5.indd 173 31-07-2020 15:27:43

#### **Do You Know?**

In Hockey, rolling substitution is allowed and any number of times a player can be substituted.

# **Functional rules of Hockey**

The rules of the hockey game are developed and modified time to time only by International Hockey Federation to add glamour and excitement in the match. These rules can be understood as given below.

#### *Teams*

Each team consists of 16 players, out of which 11 players play on the field at a time, which includes ten regular players and one goal keeper. Five substitution players remain on the sideline. In rare circumstances, a team will choose to pull its goal keeper off the field in exchange for an extra field player. The players on the sideline can be used as substitutes for any of the players on the field at any given time.

### *Coin Toss*

Before the start of the match, the umpire tosses a coin. The home team gets to choose whether it wants heads or tails. The team that wins the toss gets its choice of either possession of the ball at the start or the side of the field to defend.

### *Positions*

Positions in field hockey are not absolute. Generally, teams arrange players for defence, midfield, and attack. Many teams include a single player as the last defender called sweeper. Sweeper acts as a last line of defense in front of the goal keeper. The minimum number of players needed for a game is nine, including the goal keeper.

# *Goal Keeper*

Goal keeper is the last defender of a team and shall have distinguished jersey colour than that of teammates. A full protected goal keeper cannot leave the side's defensive 25 yards (23m) line during play, unless the goal keeper is defending a penalty stroke.

The player who is substituted as a goalkeeper must wear a helmet, a thigh pad and sometimes a shoe protector. If the team wants an additional player in the place of a goal keeper, then the goalkeeper designated player must wear different coloured jersey and cannot use their feet or hands outside the 23 meter mark.

# *Handling Hockey Stick*

The head part of a hockey stick is hooked. The right-hand side of the stick is rounded, while the left-hand side is flat. The ball can be played only with the flat, left-handed side

![](_page_45_Figure_16.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 174 31-07-2020 15:27:43

of the stick, or with its edge. The ball cannot be played with the rounded side of stick. This is natural for right-handed players and unnatural for left-handed players. Left-handed sticks are not allowed to be used in games.

### *Hitting the Ball*

To make a legal hit to the right without using the rounding side of the stick, a player must turn the stick over the ball and use the flat side. Taking a hit by reversing the stick head, turning the handle approximately 180 degrees over the ball and striking the ball with a left-to-right swing with the flat side of the stick is called reverse hit.

#### *Dribbling*

Keeping the ball under close control is called dribbling. Dribbling is used while running with possession of the ball. It helps a player to move away from the opposing players for a chance to pass or to hit on goal. Other essential skills for playing field hockey are the ability to control, pass, push, stop, and shoot the ball with the stick.

#### *Foot Foul*

Field Hockey players are not allowed to use their feet, or any other body part, to control the ball. If the ball hits a player's foot, the umpire will either award the other team a free hit or let the game continue if the other team gains an advantage. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use hands, feet, and body to stop or strike the ball.

#### *Air Ball*

The ball is allowed to be lifted in the air as long as the referee does not consider the play to be 'dangerous.' The umpire will make a call if the ball could potentially hit or injure another player. The general rule is that the ball should not be lifted above the knee within five meters of another player. An exception to this rule is when the ball is raised by using a scooping or long-pushing action of the stick, or when there are no players in the same proximity as the ball. The ball cannot be hit into the air unless it is a direct shot on goal.

#### *Scoring*

There are three different ways to score a goal in field hockey.

**1. Field goal:** A goal can only be scored if the shot is taken within the 'shooting circle', a semi-circular area in front of the opponent's goal. The shooting circle is also known as the 'D' for the defensive team. The ball must be touched by a player of either team inside the circle for it to count as a goal.

#### **Activity 5.13**

Collect information about the world governing body for hockey.

![](_page_46_Picture_15.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 175 31-07-2020 15:27:43

**2. Penalty Corner:** A penalty corner is awarded when the defensive team breaks certain rules inside the 'D', or when a defender commits an intentional offense outside the circle but within the 25 yards (23 metres) area. Teams generally have a set play for short corner. A short corner is the best opportunity to score a goal in field hockey, because the offensive team attacks with more number of players than the defensive team.

The following procedure should be applied to execute a penalty corner during the match.

- **•** Play is stopped for a penalty corner to allow time for both teams to set up its respective attack and defense positions.
- **•** Defensive team is allowed to put five defenders including the goal keeper on the end line.
- **•** The rest of the defensive team must stay behind the center line until the ball is pushed out by the offensive player.
- **•** One of the attackers will stand on the end line 11 yards (10 meters) away from the goal called 'pusher', and who pushes the ball out to the attackers on top of the shooting circle.
- **•** The ball is stopped by one of the waiting attacking team players called 'stopper', standing on the 16 yards circle. The stopper will stop the ball for the team mate to either hit or to drag the ball into goal.
- **•** In order to count a goal during a penalty corner, the ball must travel outside the shooting circle before hitting the ball into the goal. The receiver will then push the ball back into the circle for a shot to be taken. The shot has to be taken from inside the marked circle for the goal to count.
- **•** Fouls during penalty corner
	- **•** If the first shot into the goal during penalty corner is a hard hit and the ball is lifted in the air above the backboard, the goal will not be counted.
	- **•** To avoid the foul during penalty corner, the attacker must take push or scoop or flick shots in the goal. Even if the ball is lifted in the air due to push or scoop or flick shots, a goal is scored. On the international level, the 'drag flick' is the most popular type of lifted shot during the penalty corner.

**3. Penalty Stroke:** A penalty stroke is a single shot taken on goal by an offensive player chosen by the team. The goalkeeper is the only opposing player that can defend this shot. A stroke may be awarded for a number of reasons. The most common reason for a stroke to be taken is when a defender commits a foul that directly prevents a goal from being scored.

Chap-5.indd 176 31-07-2020 15:27:43

The shot is taken from a spot referred to as the penalty stroke mark. It is located 7 yards (6.4 meters) directly in front and center of the goal. Game play is stopped during the penalty stroke and all players must stand away and outside of 25 yards (23 metres) line. The player taking penalty stroke must push, flick or scoop the ball towards the goal and is permitted to raise the ball to any height.

**Fouls during penalty Stroke:** When the stick makes contact with the ball, it should make no distinct hitting noise; otherwise the umpire can disallow the penalty stroke.

#### *Free Hits*

Free hits are awarded throughout the main part of the field for general offences by either team. The most common fouls that lead to free hits are:

- **•** Obstructing an opponent from playing the ball.
- **•** Interfering with the stick or body when tackling.
- **•** Kicking the ball with leg.
- **•** Playing the ball dangerously (including lifting the ball).

# **Procedure to take a free hit**

- **•** In a free hit, the ball possession is given to the opponent team where the offence took place.
- **•** The ball is placed on the ground and a player will restart the action by passing it to a teammate, hitting the ball forward or backward, or through a self-pass (either by dribbling the ball or hitting it into space). All the opposing players must stand at least 5 yards from this player until the ball is put into play.
- **•** If the ball is within the 25 yards area of a goal, the ball cannot be directly hit into the circle. The ball must travel 5 yards by dribbling or passing before it can be hit into the circle and shot at the goal.

# *Obstruction*

In most general terms, obstruction is called when the ball is shielded from an opposing player who is trying to get the ball. Players often use their own bodies or sticks to block the ball, but third party obstruction can also be called. Third party obstruction is called when an attacking player runs to block an opponent's path (who is trying to get the ball) between a teammate who has possession of the ball.

# *Match Time*

An international match time is 60 minutes with four 15-minutequarter (first quarter 15m and 2m for rest, second quarter 15m and 10m for rest third quarter 15m and 2m for rest and fourth quarter 15m) for rest. The additional time out for

penalty corners and after goals ensure that the new 60 minutes format is primarily the actual playing time and eliminates the dead time associated with penalty corner set up while allowing the teams to enjoy their goal celebration.

#### *Penalty Shootout*

The team that scores the most goals within the match time is the winner. According to the International Hockey Federation, if no goals are scored during regulation time, the game will end in a tie or draw. In the Knock Out Tournament, the winner is decided on the basis of penalty shootout.

#### **The New Match Time Format**

- **•** Match duration: 60 minutes equally divided in four quarters
- **•** 40 seconds time out: After penalty corner awarded and after a goal scored
- **•** Two minutes break after the first and the third quarters and 10 minutes break for half time.

The penalty shootout will be taken under the following conditions—

- 1. The defending goalkeeper will stand behind his own goal line, between the goal post.
- 2. The ball is placed on the nearest 23 m line in a position opposite the center of the goal.
- 3. The umpire blows his whistle to signal the start of the shootout. The attacker and the goalkeeper may then move in any direction.
- 4. An attacker will start from behind the 23 m line near the ball.
- 5. The shootout is completed when any one of the following occur—
	- (a) 8 seconds has elapsed
	- (b) The attacker scores a goal
	- (c) The attacker commits an offence
	- (d) The goalkeeper commits an offence a goal shall be awarded
	- (e) The ball goes out-of-play over the back line, this include the goalkeeper who may intentionally play the ball over the back line to end the shootout.

#### *Umpires*

There are two umpires (or 'referees') in each game. Each umpire controls half of the field, although general play in the midfield can be called by either umpire.

![](_page_49_Picture_23.jpeg)

Chap-5.indd 178 31-07-2020 15:27:44

An umpire can give a card to any player who has committed a repeated offence. There are three types of cards:

# **Kabaddi**

# **History**

Kabaddi is an indigenous game of India which has originated and developed since the epic age of Mahabharata. The word 'Kabaddi' has been derived from the term *Kaunbada* which means 'to challenge an opponent'. The game, known as *Hu-Tu-Tu* in Western India, *Ha-Do-Do* in Eastern India and Bangladesh, *Chedugudu* in Southern India and *Kaunbada* in Northern India. Kabaddi attained national status in the year 1918. Maharashtra was the pioneer state to bring the game to the national platform and popularity. Standard rules and regulations were formulated in 1918 but were brought out in print in the year 1923 and in this very year, an All India Tournament was organised at Baroda with these rules.

Modern Kabaddi is a synthesis of the game which is played in various forms under different names. The game was introduced in the Indian Olympic Games at Calcutta in 1938. In 1950, the All India Kabaddi Federation came into existence and compiled standard rules.

The Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI) was founded in 1973. After the formation of Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India, the first men's nationals were held in Madras (renamed as Chennai), while the women's nationals were held in Calcutta (renamed as Kolkata) in 1955 (1955 does not come after 1973). The AKFI has given shape to the new rules and has the right to modify them. The Asian Kabaddi Federation was founded under the chairmanship of Janardan Singh Gehlot.

# **History of Kho-Kho**

The origin of Kho-Kho is not easy to mark out, but many historians believe that it is a modified form of 'Run and Chase', which in its simplest form involves chasing and touching a person. The popularity and development of this game has been associated with the development of 'Akharas' and 'Vyayamshalas' in Maharashtra. Probably, the game Kho-Kho has originated from Pune, Maharashtra and slowly spread within the country and also gained popularity in the neighbouring countries, i.e., Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The rules of this game were framed in 1914 by a committee of veteran players. Initially two players were made to stand at the two ends instead of the posts. The game is controlled and governed by the rules formed by Kho-Kho Federation of India which was established in 1956. It is believed that the first championship of Kho-Kho was held in 1959 at Vijaywada. 'Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal' Amravati, has given the modern form to this game. Kho-Kho game was first introduced in the National Games in 1985, held in Delhi. First Asian Kho-Kho championship was held in 1996 in Calcutta, where Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India participated. It was also introduced as a demonstration game in the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

# **Measurements of Kho-Kho Playground**

### **How to play volleyball**

- **•** A team consists of 12 players of which one of the players other than the Libero, is the team captain.
- **•** Before the match, the referee carries out a toss in the presence of the two team captains to decide upon the first service and the sides of the court in the first set. If a deciding set is to be played, a new toss will be carried out.
- **•** Before the start of each set, the coach has to present the starting line-up of six players of the team on a line-up sheet. The team's starting line-up indicates the rotational order of the players on the court. This order must be maintained throughout the set.

![](_page_67_Figure_11.jpeg)

Court positions and rotation direction

*Fig. 5.54: Player positions and rotation direction of players*

- **•** At the moment the ball is hit by the server, each team must be positioned within its own court, in the rotational order (except the server). The three players along the net are front-row players and occupy positions as— 4 (front-left), 3 (front-centre) and 2 (front-right); the other three are back-row players occupying positions 5 (back-left), 6 (back-centre) and 1 (back-right).
- **•** Rotational order is determined by the team's starting line-up and controlled with the service order and players' positions throughout the set. When the receiving team gains the right to serve, its players rotate one position clockwise—the player in position 2 rotates to position 1 to serve, the player in position 1 rotates to position 6, etc.
