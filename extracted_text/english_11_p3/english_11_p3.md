On longer evenings, Light, chill and yellow, Bathes the serene Foreheads of houses. A thrush sings, Laurel-surrounded In the deep bare garden, Its fresh-peeled voice Astonishing the brickwork. It will be spring soon, It will be spring soon— And I, whose childhood Is a forgotten boredom, Feel like a child Who comes on a scene Of adult reconciling, And can understand nothing But the unusual laughter, And starts to be happy.

# ABOUT THE POET

and *High Windows.* His themes—love, change, disenchantment, the mystery, the inexplicableness of the poet's survival and death's inevitability—are universally liked by the readers. The above poem has been taken from the volume, *The Less Deceived,* which establishes a kinship with the environment.

### UNDERSTANDING THE POEM

- 1. What does the bird in the poem announce? How is this related to the title, 'Coming'?
- 2. Why is the speaker's childhood described as 'a forgotten boredom'?
- 3. What causes the element of surprise when the child comes on the scene of 'adult reconciling'?
- 4. What two things are compared in the poem?
- 5. How do you respond to these lines? Light, chill and yellow, Bathes the serene Foreheads of houses
- 6. Comment on the use of the phrase 'fresh-peeled voice'.

#### TRY THIS OUT

- 1. The song of a bird is often the first sign of spring. Do you know the bird that signals the advent of *vasant* or spring in our country?
- 2. Do you know of other spring poems? How is this poem different from them?

#### SUGGESTED READING

- 1. 'Ambulances' by Philip Larkin.
