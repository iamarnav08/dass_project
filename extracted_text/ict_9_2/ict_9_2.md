# **Creating Textual Communication** Chapter **2**

Tanya and Rishi had gone to a book fair. They had a great time there. They wanted to share their experiences with others. So, they decided to record their experiences. Let us see how Tanya and Rishi recorded their experiences. Consider Fig. 2.1 given below and put

Let us see in Figs. 2.2 and 2.3 how they presented their experiences.

*Fig. 2.3: Rishi's Report*

Rishi was amazed to see Tanya's report. It contained text of varied colour, style and size. It also had a picture and certain symbols before each category of books. Tanya had communicated her ideas and thoughts in an organised, systematic, effective and presentable manner through her report. Rishi asked Tanya how could she communicate her thoughts so effectively?

*Tanya*: Rishi, you should know that there are digital tools which can be used to create effective and digital documents.

Chapter 2.indd 16 7/22/2020 12:34:26 PM

You can delete the errors and also take multiple copies of a digital document. My elder sister helped me to create this document using a word processor (LibreOffice Writer 5.1.6.2) on a computer (fig. 2.4).

*Fig. 2.4: LibreOffice*

Rishi also wanted to prepare his report using word processor. So, he asked Tanya to help him. After taking permission from their teacher, Rishi and Tanya went to the computer lab of their school. Tanya opened the text editor and asked Rishi to create a new document. Tanya explained to him the use of various keys on the keyboard (Fig. 2.5) for entering the text.

*Tanya*: Rishi, let's open the text editor by double clicking on the Writer icon on the desktop. Let us try to understand how we can work on the Text Editor. When we open text editor, a blank document as shown below (Fig 2.6) will appear. Tanya also demonstrated how to open a new file in the text editor. Rishi followed the steps demonstrated by Tanya for creating a new document.

The title bar of the new document contains the name of the document and the name of the application

**Document:** Any piece of information created using a text editor is called a document.

**Cursor:** A vertical blinking line in a text editor that indicates the place where anything that is typed will appear.

*Fig. 2.6: Creating a New Document*

(OpenOffice Writer). As Rishi had not given any name to his document, 'Untitled 1' is displayed on the title bar.

*Tanya*: First fix the setting of the document (Fig. 2.7) so that the page size, orientation, margins, and background colour can be fixed for the report.

*Rishi*: Why do we need to do that?

*Tanya*: Rishi, you must have noticed that the pages of your notebook are of the same size and contain margins too. This gives a consistent look to your notebook Similarly if you set the margins and size of the document in the text editor, it will give a consistent look.

*Rishi*: What are the orientation types?

*Tanya*: If you want your document vertically elongated, select 'Portrait' orientation, if you want it to be horizontally elongated, select 'Landscape' orientation.

Creating Textual Communication 19

Chapter 2.indd 19 7/22/2020 12:34:32 PM

*Rishi*: OK, so I will select page size as A4, orientation as Portrait and 0.79 inch margin on all four sides of the page.

*Tanya*: Fine! And what about the background colour?

*Rishi*: My favourite colour is yellow ochre, so I will select that as the background for my document.

Rishi was happy to see the outcome of the page setting of his document and the coloured background of his page. He started typing the text in his report. After typing, his report looked as it is shown in Fig 2.8.

| Report |
| Visit to Book Fair |
| Recently I visited the World Book Fare, held from 6th-14th January, in Pragati Maidan. |
| It was an extremely enjoyable experience for me and my friends. The book lovers |
| considered it a paradise and those who weren't so fond of books, found the mselves |
| attracted towards the endless varieties of books. |
| Stephen King famously said that "Books are a uniquely portable magic." |
| As the entire venue was stacked with books of all kinds- comics, classics, pop-up books |
| for children and many more, we could feel the magical essence of stories |
| tempting us to flip through the pages of several novels. |
| The various genres that we came across include: |
| Classics |
| Crime and Murder |
| Mystery |
| Romance |
| Adventure |
| Comic |
| Thriller |
| It is always fun to have new memories, capture them in photos and share them with |
| everyone else. |
| The students also found some books that intrigued them so much, they wanted the |
| books to be a part of the School library collection. |
| It is rightly said that reading is dreaming with your eyes open! Our visit to the book fair |
| simply reminded all of us: students and teachers alike, to never give up the habit of |
| reading. We must always keep the magical essence of books alive in our lives. |
| WE HAD LOT OF FUN! |

Chapter 2.indd 21 7/22/2020 12:34:37 PM

# Activity 1

Create a text document on a topic of your choice. Choose A4 as page size and 'portrait' as page orientation. Now change the page orientation to 'landscape' and observe the change in the document.

Once the report was typed, Tanya suggested him to save the document as shown in Fig. 2.9 and then close it. It is only when the document is saved by a name, it can be opened again for viewing or editing. In fact, while creating a document it must be saved at regular intervals so that the changes made are permanently saved. To close the file click *File → Close* option. To close the word processor (Writer), you may click Close button on the top-left corner of the screen.

*Fig. 2.9: Saving a File*

Chapter 2.indd 22 7/22/2020 12:34:41 PM

Rishi saved the file by the name *bookFairReportRishi. odt* and then closed it by clicking on the Close button. Rishi wanted to learn more from Tanya, so he opened his file again.

| • Choose Save As |

| or you want to |
| give a different |
| name to an |
| already saved file. |
| • Choose Save |
| option when you |
| want to simply |
| save the changes |

| existing file. |
| You should always |
| save a file with a |
| meaningful name. |

 *Fig. 2.10: Opening a Document*

You can also perform a task using keys from the keyboard. These are called Shortcut keys. Some of the shortcut keys are listed below:

Rishi was excited to see his report on the monitor but he wanted coloured text of different sizes in his report with a bold and underlined title. Tanya demonstrated the tools on the Formatting toolbar as shown in Fig. 2.11 that would help Rishi add these features to his report. He could choose the font name, size and style of his choice. Tanya also showed him some fonts names like Times New Roman, Courier New, Arial, Calibri, etc. She further mentioned tools to edit the font size and style—bold, italic or underlined.

You should always save a file with a meaningful name. This helps you to easily identify the file when you want to open it later.

*Fig. 2.11: Formatting text*

Rishi formatted the text in his document by using the tools on the formatting toolbar, now he wanted the title in the centre of the page and date on the top-right corner. Tanya then introduced Rishi to various alignment tools:

- Align left: aligns the text to the left margin of the page
- Center horizontally: aligns the text to centre of the page
- Align right: aligns the text to right margin of the page
- Justified: aligns the text to both left and right margin of the page

Rishi felt that his report was looking congested. He wanted a little bit more spacing between the lines of the paragraph. Tanya then explained that the spacing can be set between the lines and also between the paragraphs as shown in Fig. 2.12. The former is called

Chapter 2.indd 24 7/22/2020 12:34:46 PM

line spacing and the latter is called paragraph spacing. Demarcating a new paragraph by adding few blank spaces in the beginning of the first line of the paragraph can also be done. This is called indentation.

*Fig. 2.12: Formatting a Paragraph*

Rishi was happy to apply all the formatting effects to his document. Now his report, in Fig. 2.13 appeared more effective as compared to that shown in Fig. 2.8.

There were certain red and green wavy lines in Rishi's document. As Rishi asked her about the lines, Tanya told him that the red wavy line appears below a spelling mistake and the green wavy line appears below a grammatical error. Now, Rishi tried to correct the mistakes by placing the cursor at the appropriate position and retyping them. Tanya explained that instead of doing it manually, it can be done by using the **Spelling and Grammar** check feature of the word processor as shown in Fig. 2.14.

Suddenly, Tanya noticed that the word 'Pragati Maidan' had a red wavy line below it although it was not a spelling mistake. On the other hand, Rishi had typed the word 'fare' instead of 'fair' in his document but it did not have a red wavy line below it, as shown in Fig. 2.15.

Rishi wanted to change the position of the quote by Stephen Hawking. One method is to delete it from its present position and retype at the new position. The better way is to use the cut and paste commands, through which the text will be removed from the original position and pasted to the new position. If you want the text to be duplicated and pasted at the new position, then choose the Copy command instead of Cut command (Refer Fig. 2.17).

## Activity 3

Open the file that you created in Activity 2. Copy the quote and Paste it at the end of the document. Thereafter do it by Cut and Paste. What difference did you notice between Cut and Copy options?

Chapter 2.indd 28 7/22/2020 12:34:55 PM

In Tanya's report, Rishi had also seen certain symbols preceding the names of the genres of books. When Rishi asked her, Tanya explained that such a list can be created using the **Bullets and Numbering** feature of the text editor as shown in Fig. 2.18. Using Bullets feature, the list is preceded by certain symbols. For list items, shown by bullets ordering is not important, on the other hand, **Number and Alphabets** feature can be used when there is some order in the list.

Rishi used bullets as shown in Fig. 2.19 to list the different categories of books he had seen in the book fair.

- Steps to make a cup of tea (Bullets/Numbering)
- List of your favourite games (Bullets/Numbering)

During his visit to the book fair, Rishi had made a list of his favourite books and CDs in his diary. He wanted to create a table depicting Serial Number of the listed books and CDs, Title of the book and CD and Name of the Publisher. Tanya explained the table feature to help him complete the task. He inserted a table (as shown in Fig. 2.20) with three rows and four columns. Tanya also explained him how to insert more rows and columns in the table. He inserted two more rows at the bottom of the table (as shown in Fig. 2.21), since he needed to add 5 names.

To further enhance the report, Tanya demonstrated how to insert headers and footers in the document as shown in Fig. 2.27. A header contains the text that will be displayed on the top of each page of the document while the text in footer will be displayed at the bottom of each page of the document. Rishi wanted to insert the text 'Rishi's Report' as the header and page number as the footer.

Answer the following questions based on the above activity.

- In which menu option did you find the table option?
- Have you inserted a bullet list or a number list?
- How many rows and columns does your table have?
- What did you insert as a footer in your document?

Rishi was very happy to see his document now. He wanted to show it to his teacher and parents. So, he decided to take two printouts. Before giving the print command, Tanya clicked the File→Print Preview button

Keep saving your document at regular intervals.

*Fig. 2.29: Print Preview*

Creating Textual Communication 35

Chapter 2.indd 35 7/22/2020 12:35:13 PM

Take a print out only if it is required. Avoid wasting paper and contribute your bit towards saving trees.

If the report is in digital form, either saved in some storage device or seen on the monitor, it is called a **soft copy.**

The report that is printed on the paper is called a **hard copy.**

It is not ethical to see or edit other people's documents and material without seeking permission.

to show Rishi how the document would appear on paper. By doing so both the pages of Rishi's report were displayed as shown in Fig. 2.29. Tanya told him how to set the number of pages that he wanted to see while previewing the document. Since Rishi was happy with his final report, he clicked Close Preview button to close the preview. Tanya again reminded him to save the document and Rishi clicked the Save command. Now it was time to print Rishi's report. He switched on the printer and made sure that the printer was connected to the computer. Then he opened the Print dialog box and selected '2' for the number of copies of the document to be printed as shown in Fig. 2.30.

#### *Fig. 2.30: Printing a document*

Next day, Rishi and Tanya opened the document to show it to their friends in the computer lab of their school. On opening the file, they were surprised to see that the document was not the same one that they had saved a day before. Some student might have altered the report. Their teacher explained that their document had been saved in an editable format, so it could be modified or edited by anybody. If they wanted that their document should not be edited or modified in any manner, then they should convert and save their file in a non-editable format. One such format is a Portable Document Format (pdf). Once a document is saved in

Chapter 2.indd 36 7/22/2020 12:35:14 PM

this format (as shown in Fig. 2.31), it becomes non-editable. Their teacher then explained how to convert the final document into pdf format.
