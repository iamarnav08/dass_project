## **Text I**

The following excerpt is from the diary of Lena Mukhina, a teenage girl who had undergone the atrocities of Germans when they fortified the city of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad is an important landmark in the history of Russia. The siege of Leningrad lasted from September 1941 to 1944. The city was cut off from the rest of Russia. The Germans continuously bombarded the city which resulted in death, destruction, and starvation of the people. However, the resolute Russians were warned in the beginning that the enemy was at the gate and it was a question of life and death. They fought bravely and failed the Germans in their evil designs.

Read the excerpt and answer the questions that follow.

#### **Foreword from** *The Diary of Lena Mukhina*

No one could possibly have known that the city would remain in the grip of siege for 872 days and nights. But Leningrad's citizens had begun to feel the breath of war as early as September. Daily

inclement weather for the reduced visibility it brought. They came to dread sunny days and moonlit nights, when the Germans would be sure to bomb their city. Cloud cover, however, offered no protection from artillery fire: in just over six months from the start of the siege there were only thirty-two days when shells did not explode on the city's streets. Hunger soon set in. Between September and November 1941 the bread rations that had been announced in July were reduced five times, reaching their lowest point on 20 November—125 'blockade grams' for children, dependents and white-collar workers and 250g for manual workers, technicians and engineers. Rations of meat, butter, sugar and other food

air raids and artillery bombardment of residential neighbourhoods drove the city's inhabitants into bomb shelters, several times a day, and for hours at a time. People's initial curiosity in the aftermath of the first bomb attacks soon gave way to fear and then, in conditions of appalling hunger and cold, to apathy. Leningraders welcomed

items were severely reduced. The summer months and the beginning of autumn, when it was still possible to buy food without ration cards in ordinary shops and canteens were no more than a distant memory.

## **Text II**

There are many ways of recording the events, news, and personal experiences. Diary writing, logbook, daybook, journal, etc. are a few to name. The journal writing is about writing the everyday record of an event or writing about an event, activity or experience, etc.

The following is an excerpt from the beginning of *A Journal of the Plague Year* by Daniel Defoe.

#### *A Journal of the Plague Year*

It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods which were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.

We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practiced since. But such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them were handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.

But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence, it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house

and make inspection. This they did; and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon, it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner, thus — Plague 2. Parishes infected 1.

Lena Mukhina's Diary 22 May 1941–25 May 1942

'Remember My Sad Story: Lena Mukhina's Siege Diary'

Consider any day on which you do not discover anything new or learn anything useful a lost day!

Anyone can become strong, smart and steadfast. There is only one essential requirement–will power!

Will power can conquer anything. A strong-willed person is persistent and determined.

People are not born brave, strong and smart. These qualities must be acquired through perseverance and with determination, like the ability to read and write.

# Do you know

One of the three islands in the Juan Fernandez archipelago, 700 km off the Pacific coast of Chile was discovered in the 16th century. Alexander Selkirk, the Scottish sailor was marooned there for four years and four months. He related his experience to Daniel Defoe, who wrote his famous adventure book Robinson Crusoe based on the sailor's experience, since then the island is known as Robinson Crusoe.

There is a seemingly unbelievable true story of the orphaned bear cub, which was found by Polish troops during World War II who travelled with them through Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Italy and Scotland. During the war, Wojciech Narebski and his fellow Polish servicemen had to lift crates of heavy metal artillery. Fortunately for them, one of the soldiers had superhuman strength: Corporal Wojtek, a Syrian brown bear. When the bear saw that soldiers were struggling, he'd want to help... he'd come over, grab a crate and carry it to the truck. This can be heavy work, even for a bear. When Wojtek (bear) got tired, he would simply stack one crate on top of the other which also helped the soldiers because they didn't have to lift the crate off the ground. Of course, Corporal Wojtek (bear) got a reward of honey and marmalade. That was his favourite!

You know, things can happen that you wouldn't normally think are true. Collect some more stories under the title— 'Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.'
