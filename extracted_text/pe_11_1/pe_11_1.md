In modern times, Physical Education is one of the most exciting and dynamic subjects. This subject has changed dramatically during the last 50 years. It has expanded in different areas from school to non-school setting and from school-aged children to people of all ages. Earlier, physical education was generally understood as physical activities either in school time table or some free hand exercises, games, sports, racing, swimming, etc. If we look at the Indian history of physical education after Independence, a number of schemes were launched by the Government of India for schools, where every student must participate in physical activities. We can witness the growing interest in games and sports exemplified by the fitness boom and the wellness movement. Sports events receive worldwide coverage. In schools, students like sports and other forms of physical activities, which help to achieve and maintain their health and well-being.

# **Meaning and Definition**

Physical Education is an education which brings improvement in human performance with the help of physical activities. Physical activities range from simple walking to jogging, running, sprinting, hopping, jumping, climbing, throwing, pushing, pulling, kicking, etc. Education without physical activities is like body without soul. There is no controversy in giving due place to physical education and different forms of exercises in the total set-up of education. All teachings in human education begin with physical education. Physical education is also considered as movement education as the life begins from movement only. In general life is characterised by movement. The movement starts from the birth of a child, till the end of life.

education (1956) states that, "Physical education should aim at making the child physically, mentally and emotionally fit and developing personal and social qualities which will help to live happily with others and build a good citizen". It further emphasises that the development of the total personality and achievement of worthy citizenship motivated for service should be the outcomes of physical education.

Physical education programme should also aim to build good citizens of the country."

According to the Central Advisory Board of Physical Education and Recreation, "Physical education is the process of education through physical activities. It is the development of the total personality of the child to its fullness and perfection in body, mind and spirit."

Sports and physical education are an integral part of the learning process, and need to be included in the evaluation of performance. A nation-wide infrastructure for physical education, sports and games are required in the educational field. The infrastructure consists of playfields, equipments, coaches and teachers of physical education. Available open spaces in urban areas can be used for playgrounds. Efforts should be made to establish sports institutions and hostels where specialised attention can be given to sports activities and sports-related studies, along with normal education. Appropriate encouragement should be given to those who have talent in sports and games. Due focus should be given on indigenous traditional games.

According to American Alliance for health, physical education, recreation and dance, "Physical Education is education through physical activities which are selected and carried as with regard to value in human growth, development and behaviour".

Finally, it can be concluded that the development of all personality traits like, physical, social, mental, emotional, and moral takes place through various programmes of physical education.

# **Aims and Objectives**

If you are doing physical exercises or playing any game regularly, you must have realised their importance. The aim of physical education is to target the total development of human personality. In physical education, the final aim is to make every human being physically, mentally and emotionally fit and also to provide each kind of opportunity to them, so that they can develop such personal and social qualities which will help them to live happily with others and shape themselves as true citizens of the country.

Efforts are needed to provide adequate facilities and ample time for the individuals and the groups to participate in situations that are physically wholesome, mentally stimulating and socially sound. Through physical education one can strive to achieve the following aims and objectives.

### **Motor Development**

The objective of motor development refers to the neuromuscular relationship of nerve or nerve fibre to the one that connects the central nervous system with muscles. This in turn enables the movement of the body. To enhance the ability of the body to act, react and interact, it is necessary to exercise the muscles and nerves. In other words, physical development of a person is the foremost objective of physical education. Physical education is related to physical activities, which when performed, have an effect on various organ systems of our body. It leads to the improvement in size, shape, efficiency, etc., of various organs of these systems. An individual who is having good motor movements may perform daily routine work very effectively without undue

fatigue and laziness and feels confident in life. It also promotes sound health which enables an individual to become a valuable asset for the society and nation.

Motor development can be possible through participating in different kinds of physical activity programmes like, games, sports, yoga, dance, etc.

## **Mental Development**

Mental development refers to the ability to think and solve problems effectively. Knowledge received by participating in physical activities about body movement, health, fitness, sanitation, nutrition, disease prevention and others may contribute to an individual's mental development. A mentally developed person takes wise decisions at the right time and in a right spirit. Mental development objectives deal with a person's ability to think correctly, act wisely and skillfully in all situations of life. Various activities conducted in physical education classes not only require physical strength but also need mental alertness, deep concentration, and precise movements. In this manner, physical education also sharpens the mind and makes it more efficient.

### **Emotional Development**

experiences, such as, fear, anger, joy, love, sorrow, etc. It is usually a feeling which has specially become intense. For example, joy means intense pleasure. A child needs to develop confidence, a feeling of belongingness, and eliminate negative feelings through participating in games, sports, yoga, etc.

### **Social Development**

This objective of physical education refers to the feeling of belongingness, adjustment of group living, social poise, social relationships, and social adjustment. Physical activities provide such opportunities to the children to fulfil basic needs like, recognition, self-respect, belongingness, and love. When these needs are fulfilled, the individual becomes a well-adjusted social person. While participating in physical activities including games and sports, an individual acquires social qualities, such as, cooperation, friendship, courtesy, empathy, team spirit, democratic living, sportspersonship, etc. These qualities are essential for social development.

### **Moral Development**

Every game has a set of rules and regulations and it is the duty of each player to obey them. The players know that disobedience of any rule is a moral crime that can result in their expulsion from the team. Therefore, obedience of these rules becomes the moral duty of each player. Participation in games helps in moral development and equips them to differentiate between right and wrong with honesty. Hence, physical education also plays an important role in the moral development of a person.

# **Need and Importance of Physical Education in the Modern Society**

The modern researches have proven that the views of Greek philosophers Aristotle and Socrates in considering athletics as complete education is correct. It has been scientifically observed that adequate exercise of limbs is essential for disciplining one's mind in the right spirit. Regular exercises and playing games help the body and mind to deal with the modern day silent killers, such as, stress, strain, worry, anxiety and tension. The need and importance of physical education may be understood in several ways which describes the different kinds of requirements for various sections of the society.

![](_page_5_Picture_11.jpeg)

Chap-1.indd 6 31-07-2020 15:24:32

Health and Physical Education must continue to be a compulsory subject from the primary, to the secondary stages, and as an optional subject at the higher secondary stage. However, it needs to be given equal status with other subjects, a status that is not being given at present. In order to transact the curriculum effectively, it is essential to ensure that the minimum essential physical space and equipment are available in every school, and that doctors and medical personnel visit school regularly.

It should be possible to organise the utilisation of school space, at the block level at least, for special sports programmes both before school hours and after school hours to enable children with special talents for sports to come here for special training and during vacation periods. It should also be possible to develop these sports facilities so that many more children can avail of these for leisure-time sports activities and engage with team games such as basketball, throwball, volleyball, and local forms of sports.
