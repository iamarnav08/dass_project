# APPENDIX A 7

# GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR USING SYMBOLS FOR PHYSICAL QUANTITIES, CHEMICAL ELEMENTS AND NUCLIDES

- Symbols for physical quantities are normally single letters and printed in italic (or sloping) type. However, in case of the two letter symbols, appearing as a factor in a product, some spacing is necessary to separate this symbol from other symbols.
- Abbreviations, i.e., shortened forms of names or expressions, such as p.e. for potential energy, are not used in physical equations. These abbreviations in the text are written in ordinary normal/roman (upright) type.
- Vectors are printed in bold and normal/roman (upright) type. However, in class room situations, vectors may be indicated by an arrow on the top of the symbol.
- Multiplication or product of two physical quantities is written with some spacing between them. Division of one physical quantity by another may be indicated with a horizontal bar or with

solidus, a slash or a short oblique stroke mark (/) or by writing it as a product of the numerator and the inverse first power of the denominator, using brackets at appropriate places to clearly distinguish between the numerator and the denominator.

- Symbols for chemical elements are written in normal/roman (upright) type. The symbol is not followed by a full stop.
For example, Ca, C, H, He, U, etc.

- The attached numerals specifying a nuclide are placed as a left subscript (atomic number) and superscript (mass number).
For example, a U-235 nuclide is expressed as 92 235U (with 235 expressing the mass number and 92 as the atomic number of uranium with chemical symbol U).

- The right superscript position is used, if required, for indicating a state of ionisation (in case of ions).
For example, Ca2+ , 3− PO4

# APPENDIX A 8

# GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR USING SYMBOLS FOR SI UNITS, SOME OTHER UNITS, AND SI PREFIXES

- Symbols for units of physical quantities are printed/written in Normal/Roman (upright) type.
- Standard and recommended symbols for units are written in lower case roman (upright) type, starting with small letters. The shorter designations for units such as kg, m, s, cd, etc., are symbols and not the abbreviations. The unit names are never capitalised. However, the unit symbols are capitalised only if the symbol for a unit is derived from a proper name of scientist, beginning with a capital, normal/roman letter.

For example, m for the unit 'metre', d for the unit 'day', atm for the unit 'atmospheric pressure', Hz for the unit 'hertz', Wb for the unit 'weber', J for the unit 'joule', A for the unit 'ampere', V for the unit 'volt', etc. The single exception is L, which is the symbol for the unit 'litre'. This exception is made to avoid confusion of the lower case letter l with the Arabic numeral l.

- Symbols for units do not contain any final full stop at the end of recommended letter and remain unaltered in the plural, using only singular form of the unit. For example, for a length of 25 centimetres the unit symbol is written as 25 cm and not 25 cms or 25 cm. or 25 cms., etc.
- Use of solidus ( / ) is recommended only for indicating a division of one letter unit symbol by another unit symbol. Not more than one solidus is used. For example : m/s2 or m s–2 (with a spacing between m and s–2) but not m/s/s;

1 Pl =1 N s m –2 = 1 N s/m2 = 1 kg/s m=1 kg m–1 s–1, but not 1 kg/m/s; J/K mol or J K–1 mol–1, but not J/K/mol; etc.

- Prefix symbols are printed in normal/roman (upright) type without spacing between the prefix symbol and the unit symbol. Thus certain approved prefixes written very close to the unit symbol are used to indicate decimal fractions or multiples of a SI unit, when it is inconveniently small or large.
For example :

| megawatt ( 1MW = 106 W); | nanosecond (1 ns = 10–9 s); |
| --- | --- |
| centimetre (1 cm = 10–2 m); | picofarad (1 pF = 10–12 F);. |
| kilometre ( 1 km = 103 m); | microsecond (1µs = 10–6 s); |
| millivolt (1 mV= 10–3 V); | gigahertz (1GHz = 109 Hz); |

kilowatt-hour (1 kW h = 103 W h = 3.6 MJ = 3.6 × 106 J); microampere (1µ A = 10–6 A); micron (1µm = 10–6 m); angstrom (1 Α ° =0.1 nm = 10–10 m); etc.

The unit 'micron' which equals 10–6 m, i.e. a micrometre, is simply the name given to convenient sub-multiple of the metre. In the same spirit, the unit 'fermi', equal to a femtometre or 10–15 m has been used as the convenient length unit in nuclear studies. Similarly, the unit 'barn', equal to 10–28 m2 , is a convenient measure of cross-sectional areas in sub-atomic particle collisions. However, the unit 'micron' is preferred over the unit 'micrometre' to avoid confusion of the 'micrometre' with the length measuring instrument called 'micrometer'. These newly formed multiples or sub-multiples (cm, km, µm, µs, ns) of SI units, metre and second, constitute a new composite inseparable symbol for units.

- When a prefix is placed before the symbol of a unit, the combination of prefix and symbol is considered as a new symbol, for the unit, which can be raised to a positive or negative power without using brackets. These can be combined with other unit symbols to form compound unit. Rules for binding-in indices are not those of ordinary algebra. For example :
cm3 means always (cm)3 = (0.01 m)3 = (10–2 m)3 = 10–6 m3 , but never 0.01 m3 or

10–2 m3 or 1cm3 (prefix c with a spacing with m3 is meaningless as prefix c is to be attached to a unit symbol and it has no physical significance or independent existence without attachment with a unit symbol).

Similarly, mA2 means always (mA)2 = (0.001A)2 = (10–3 A)2 =10–6 A2 , but never 0.001 A2 or 10–3 A 2 or m A 2 ;

.

1 cm–1 = (10–2m)–1=102 m–1, but not 1c m–1 or 10–2 m–1; 1µs –1 means always (10–6s)–1=106 s–1, but not 1 × 10–6 s–1; 1 km2 means always (km)2 = (103 m)2 =106 m2 , but not 103 m2 ; 1mm2 means always (mm)2 = (10–3 m)2 =10–6 m2 , but not 10–3 m2

- A prefix is never used alone. It is always attached to a unit symbol and written or fixed before (pre-fix) the unit symbol.
	- For example :

103 /m3 means 1000/m3 or 1000 m-3, but not k/m3 or k m-3 .

106 /m3 means 10,00,000/m3 or 10,00,000 m–3, but not M/m3 or M m–3

- Prefix symbol is written very close to the unit symbol without spacing between them, while unit symbols are written separately with spacing when units are multiplied together. For example :
m s-1 (symbols m and s–1, in lower case, small letter m and s, are separate and independent unit symbols for metre and second respectively, with spacing between them) means 'metre per second', but not 'milli per second'.

Similarly, ms–1 [symbol m and s are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m (for prefix milli) and unit symbol s, in lower case, small letter (for unit 'second') without any spacing between them and making ms as a new composite unit] means 'per millisecond', but never 'metre per second'.

mS–1[symbol m and S are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m (for prefix milli) and unit symbol S, in capital roman letter S (for unit 'siemens') without any spacing between them, and making mS as a new composite unit] means 'per millisiemens', but never 'per millisecond'.

C m [symbol C and m are written separately, representing unit symbols C (for unit 'coulomb') and m (for unit 'metre'), with spacing between them] means 'coulomb metre', but never 'centimetre', etc.

- The use of double prefixes is avoided when single prefixes are available. For example :
10–9 m = 1nm (nanometre), but not 1mµm (millimicrometre),

10–6 m= 1µm (micron), but not 1mmm(millimillimetre),

10–12 F= 1 pF (picofarad), but not 1µµF (micromicrofarad),

109 W=1 GW (giga watt), but not 1 kMW (kilomegawatt), etc.

- The use of a combination of unit and the symbols for units is avoided when the physical quantity is expressed by combining two or more units.
For example :

joule per mole kelvin is written as J/mol K or J mol–1 K–1, but not joule/mole K or J/ mol kelvin or J/mole K, etc.

joule per tesla is written as J/T or J T–1, but not joule /T or J per tesla or J/tesla, etc.

newton metre second is written as N m s, but not Newton m second or N m second or N metre s or newton metre s, etc.

joule per kilogram kelvin is written as J/kg K or J kg–1 K–1, but not J/kilog K or joule/kg K or J/ kg kelvin or J/kilogram K, etc.

- To simplify calculations, the prefix symbol is attached to the unit symbol in the numerator and not to the denominator.
For example :

106 N/m2 is written more conveniently as MN/m2 , in preference to N/mm2 .

A preference has been expressed for multiples or sub-multiples involving the factor 1000, 10+3n where n is the integer.

- Proper care is needed when same symbols are used for physical quantities and units of physical quantities.
For example :

The physical quantity weight (*W*) expressed as a product of mass (*m*) and acceleration due to gravity (*g*) may be written in terms of symbols *W*, *m* and *g* printed in italic ( or sloping) type as *W* = *m g*, preferably with a spacing between *m* and *g*. It should not be confused with the unit symbols for the units watt (W), metre (m) and gram (g). However, in the equation *W*=*m g*, the symbol *W* expresses the weight with a unit symbol J, *m* as the mass with a unit symbol kg and *g* as the acceleration due to gravity with a unit symbol m/s2 . Similarly, in equation *F* = *m a*, the symbol *F* expresses the force with a unit symbol N, *m* as the mass with a unit symbol kg, and *a* as the acceleration with a unit symbol m/s2 . These symbols for physical quantities should not be confused with the unit symbols for the units 'farad' (F), 'metre'(m) and 'are' (a).

Proper distinction must be made while using the symbols h (prefix hecto, and unit hour), c (prefix centi, and unit carat), d (prefix deci and unit day), T (prefix tera, and unit tesla), a (prefix atto, and unit are), da (prefix deca, and unit deciare), etc.

- SI base unit 'kilogram' for mass is formed by attaching SI prefix (a multiple equal to 103 ) 'kilo' to a cgs (centimetre, gram, second) unit 'gram' and this may seem to result in an anomaly. Thus, while a thousandth part of unit of length (metre) is called a millimetre (mm), a thousandth part of the unit of mass (kg) is not called a millikilogram, but just a gram. This appears to give the impression that the unit of mass is a gram (g) which is not true. Such a situation has arisen because we are unable to replace the name 'kilogram' by any other suitable unit. Therefore, as an exception, name of the multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed by attaching prefixes to the word 'gram' and not to the word 'kilogram'. For example :
103 kg =1 megagram ( 1Mg), but not 1 kilo kilogram (1 kkg);

10–6 kg = 1 milligram ( 1 mg), but not 1 microkilogram ( 1µkg);

10–3 kg = 1 gram (1g), but not 1 millikilogram (1 mkg), etc.

It may be emphasised again that you should use the internationally approved and recommended symbols only. Continual practice of following general rules and guidelines in unit symbol writing would make you learn mastering the correct use of SI units, prefixes and related symbols for physical quantities in a proper perspective.
