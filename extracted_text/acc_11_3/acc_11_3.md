- *• describe the nature of transaction and source documents;*
- *• explain the preparation of accounting vouchers;*
- *• apply accounting equation to explain the effect of transactions;*
- *• record transactions using rules of debit and credit;*

I n chapter 1 and 2, while explaining the development and importance of accounting as a source of disseminating the financial information along with the discussion on basic accounting concepts that guide the recording of business transactions, it has been indicated that accounting involves a process of identifying and analysing the business transactions, recording them, classifying and summarising their effects and finally communicating it to the interested users of accounting information.

In this chapter, we will discuss the details of each step involved in the accounting process. The first step involves identifying the transactions to be recorded and preparing the source documents which are in turn recorded in the basic book of original entry called journal and are then posted to individual accounts in the principal book called *ledger*.

### 3.1 Business Transactions and Source Document

After securing good percentage in your previous examination, as promised, your father wishes to buy you a computer. You go to the market along with your father to buy a computer. The dealer gives a *cash memo* along with the computer and in exchange your father makes cash payment of ` 35,000. Purchase of computer for cash is an example of a *transaction*, which involves reciprocal exchange of two things: (i) *payment of cash,* (ii) *delivery of a computer*. Hence, the transaction involves this aspect, i.e. *Give* and *Take*. Payment of cash involves *give* aspect and delivery of computer is a *take* aspect. Thus, business transactions are exchanges of economic consideration between parties and have two-fold effects that are recorded in at least two accounts.

Business transactions are usually evidenced by an appropriate documents such as Cash memo, Invoice, Sales bill, Pay-in-slip, Cheque, Salary slip, etc. A document which provides evidence of the transactions is called the *Source Document or a Voucher*. At times, there may be no documentary for certain items as in case of petty expenses. In such case voucher may be prepared showing the necessary details and got approved by appropriate authority within the firm. All such documents (vouchers) are arranged in chronological order and are serially numbered and kept in a separate file. All recording in books of account is done on the basis of vouchers.

# *3.1.1 Preparation of Accounting Vouchers*

Accounting vouchers may be classified as cash vouchers, debit vouchers, credit vouchers, journal vouchers, etc. There is no set format of accounting vouchers. A specimen of a simple transaction voucher is used in practice is shown in figure 3.1.

These must be preserved in any case till the audit of the accounts and tax assessments for the relevant period are completed. Now a days, accounting is computerised and the necessary accounting vouchers showing the code number and name of the accounts to be debited and credited are prepared for the purpose of necessary recording of transactions. A transaction with one debit and one credit is a simple transaction and the accounting vouchers prepared for such transaction is known as *Transaction Voucher,* the format of which is shown in figure 3.1. Voucher which records a transaction that entails multiple debits/credits and one credit/debit is called compound voucher. Compound voucher may be: (a) *Debit Voucher o7r (b) Credit Voucher*; the specimen is shown in figure 3.2.

Transactions with multiple *debits* and multiple *credits* are called complex transactions and the accounting voucher prepared for such transaction is known as *Complex Voucher/ Journal Voucher.* The format of a complex transaction voucher is shown in figure 3.3.

Fig. 3.3 *: Showing specimen of complex transaction voucher*

The design of the accounting vouchers depends upon the nature, requirement and convenience of the business. There is no set format of an accounting voucher. To distinguish various vouchers, different colour papers and different fonts of printing are used. Some of the specimen of the accounting vouchers are given in the earlier pages. An accounting voucher must contain the following essential elements :

- It is written on a good quality paper;
- Name of the firm must be printed on the top;
- Date of transactionis filled up against the date and not the date of recording of transaction is to be mentioned;
- The number of the voucher is to be in a serial order;
- Name of the accountto be debited or credited is mentioned;
- Debit and credit amount is to be written in figures against the amount;
- Description of the transaction is to be given account wise;
- The person who prepares the voucher must mention his name along with signature; and
- The name and signature of the authorised person are mentioned on the voucher.

# 3.2 Accounting Equation

Accounting equation signifies that the assets of a business are always equal to the total of its liabilities and capital (*owner's equity*). The equation reads as follows:

> A = L + C Where, A = Assets L = Liabilities C = Capital

The above equation can also be presented in the following forms as its derivatives to enable the determination of missing figures of Capital(C) or Liabilities(L).

- (i) A L = C
- (ii) A C = L

Since, the accounting equation depicts the fundamental relationship among the components of the balance sheet, it is also called the Balance Sheet Equation. As the name suggests, the balance sheet is a statement of assets, liabilities and capital.

At any point of time resources of the business entity must be equal to the claims of those who have financed these resources. The proprietors and outsiders provide the resources of the business. The claim of the proprietors is called *capital* and that of the outsides is known as *liabilities.* Each element of the equation is the part of balance sheet, which states the financial position of the business on a particular date. When we analyse the transactions, we actually try to know that how balance sheet of a business entity gets affected.

Asset side of the balance sheet is the list of assets, which the business entity owns. The liabilities side of the balance sheet is the list of owner's claims and outsider's claims, i.e., what the business entity owes. The equality of the assets side and the liabilities side of the balance sheet is an undeniable fact and this justifies the name of accounting equation as balance sheet equation also.

For example, Rohit started business with a capital of ` 5,00,000. From the accounting point of view, the resources of this business entity is in the form of cash, i.e., ` 5,00,000. Sources of this business entity is the contribution by Rohit (Proprietor) ` 5,00,000 as Capital .

*(For the purpose of understanding we will refer this example as example 1, throughout the chapter*) .

If we put this information in the form of equality of resources and sources, the picture would emerge somewhat as follows:

| Liabilities | Amount | Assets | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ` |  | ` |
| Capital | 5,00,000 | Cash in hand | 5,00,000 |
|  | 5,00,000 |  | 5,00,000 |

Books of Rohit Balance Sheet as at ..........

In the above balance sheet, the total assets are equal to the liabilities of the business. Since, the business has not yet started its activities and has not earned any profits; the amount invested in business is still ` 5,00,000. In case any profits are earned, it will increase the invested amount in business. On the other hand, if business suffers any losses, it will decrease the invested amount in business.

We will now analyse the transactions listed in example 1 and its effect on different elements and you will observe that the accounting equation always remain balanced:

# *Example 1.*

- 1. Opened a bank account in State Bank of India with an amount of ` 4,80,000.
*Analysis of transaction:* This transaction increases the cash at bank (assets) and decreases cash (asset) by ` 4,80,000.

- 2. Bought furniture for ` 60,000 and cheque was issued on the same day.
*Analysis of transaction: This transaction increases furniture (assets) and decreases bank (assets) by* ` *60,000.*

- 3. Bought plant and machinery for the business for ` 1,25,000 and an advance of ` 10,000 in cash is paid to M/s Ramjee Lal.
*Analysis of transaction: This transaction increases plant and machinery (assets) by* ` *1,25,000, decreases cash by* ` *10,000 and increases liabilities (M/s Ramjee lal as creditor) by* ` *1,15,000.*

- 4. Goods purchased from M/s Sumit Traders for ` 55,000.
*Analysis of transaction: This transaction increases goods (assets) and increases liabilities (M/s Sumit Traders as creditors) by* ` *55,000.*

- 5. Goods costing ` 25,000 sold to Rajani Enterprises for ` 35,000. *Analysis of transaction: This transaction decreases stock of goods (assets) by* ` *25,000 and increases assets* (Rajani Enterprises as debtors ` 35,000) and capital (with the profit of ` 10,000)
The final equation as per the above analysis table can be summarised in the form of a balance sheet as under:

| Liabilities | Amount | Assets | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ` |  | ` |
| Outsider's Claims (Creditors) | 1,70,000 | Cash | 10,000 |
| Capital | 5,10,000 | Bank | 4,20,000 |
|  |  | Debtors | 35,000 |
|  |  | Stock | 30,000 |
|  |  | Furniture | 60,000 |
|  |  | Plant & Machinery | 1,25,000 |
|  | 6,80,000 |  | 6,80,000 |

Balance Sheet as at.....2017

In terms of accounting equation A = L + C ` 6,80,000 = ` 1,70,000 + ` 5,10,000

# 3.3 Using Debit and Credit

As already stated every transaction involves give and take aspect. In double entry accounting, every transaction affects and is recorded in at least two accounts. When recording each transaction, the *total amount debited must equal to the total amount credited.* In accounting, the terms — *debit* and *credit* indicate whether the transactions are to be recorded on the left hand side or right hand side of the account. In its simplest form, an account looks like the letter T. Because of its shape, this simple form called a T-account (refer figure 3.4). Notice that the T format has a left side and a right side for recording increases and decreases in the item. This helps in ascertaining the ultimate position of each item at the end of an accounting period. For example, if it is an account of a customer all goods sold shall appear on the left (debit) side of customer's account and all payments received on the right side. The difference between the totals of the two sides called *balance* shall reflect the amount due to the customer. In a T account, the left side is called *debit* (often abbreviated as Dr.) and the right side is known as *credit* (often abbreviated as Cr.). To

The summary of effects of transactions on accounting equation is in the following analysis table:

# *3.3.1 Rules of Debit and Credit*

All accounts are divided into five categories for the purposes of recording the transactions: (a) Asset (b) Liability (c) Capital (d) Expenses/Losses, and (e) Revenues/Gains.

Two fundamental rules are followed to record the changes in these accounts:

- *(1) For recording changes in Assets/Expenses (Losses):*
	- (i) "Increase in asset is debited, and *decrease* in asset is credited."
	- (ii) "Increase in expenses/losses is debited, and *decrease* in expenses/ losses is credited."
- *(2) For recording changes in Liabilities and Capital/Revenues (Gains):*
	- (i) "*Increase* in liabilities is credited and *decrease* in liabilities is debited."
	- (ii) "*Increase* in capital is credited and *decrease* in capital is debited."
	- (iii) "*Increase* in revenue/gain is credited and *decrease* in revenue/gain is debited."

The rules applicable to the different kinds of accounts have been summarised in the following chart:

|  | Asset |  | Liabilities |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (Increase) |  | (Decrease) | (Decrease) | (Increase) |
| + |  | – | – | + |
| Debit |  | Credit | Debit | Credit |
|  | Capital |  |  |  |
| (Decrease) |  | (Increase) | Expenses/Losses |  |
| – |  | + |  |  |
| Debit |  | Credit | (Increase) | (Decrease) |
|  | Revenues/Gains |  | + | – |
|  |  |  | Debit | Credit |
| (Decrease) |  | (Increase) |  |  |
| – |  | + |  |  |
| Debit |  | Credit |  |  |

# Rules of Debit and Credit

The transactions in Example 1 on page 46 will help you to learn how to apply these debit and credit rules. Observe the analysis table given on page 48 carefully to be sure that you understand before you go on to the next one. To illustrate different kinds of events, three more transactions have been added (transactions 7 to 9).

| Assets |  |  | = | Liabilities + Capital |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cash | + | Inventory(Stock) |  |  |  |
| 8,00,000 + |  | 50,000 | = |  | 8,50,000 |
| Total |  | 8,50,000 | = | 8,50,000 |  |

# 3.4 Books of Original Entry

In the preceding pages, you learnt about debits and credits and observed how transactions affect accounts. This process of analysing transactions and recording their effects directly in the accounts is helpful as a learning exercise. However, real accounting systems do not record transactions directly in the accounts. The book in which the transaction is recorded for the first time is called journal or book of original entry. The source document, as discussed earlier, is required to record the transaction in the journal. This practice provides a complete record of each transaction in one place and links the debits and credits for each transaction. After the debits and credits for each transaction are entered in the journal, they are transferred to the individual accounts. The process of recording transactions in journal is called journalising. Once the *journalising* process is completed, the journal entry provides a complete and useful description of the event's effect on the organisation. The process of transferring journal entry to individual accounts is called *posting*. This sequence causes the journal to be called the B*ook of Original Entry* and the ledger account as the *Principal Book* of entry. In this context, it should be noted that on account of the number and commonality of most transactions, the journal is subdivided into a number of books of original entry as follows:

- (a) Journal Proper
- (b) Cash book
- (c) Other day books:
	- (i) Purchases (journal) book
	- (ii) Sales (journal) book
	- (iii) Purchase Returns (journal) book
	- (iv) Sale Returns (journal) book
	- (v) Bills Receivable (journal) book
	- (vi) Bills Payable (journal) book

In this chapter you will learn about the process of journalising and their posting into ledger. The cash book and other day books are dealt in detail in chapter 4.

# *3.4.1 Journal*

This is the basic book of original entry. In this book, transactions are recorded in the chronological order, as and when they take place. Afterwards, transactions from this book are posted to the respective accounts. Each transaction is separately recorded after determining the particular account to be debited or credited. The format of Journal is shown is figure 3.5

|  | Journal |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Date | Particulars | L.F. | Debit Amount | Credit Amount |
|  |  |  | ` | ` |

# Fig. 3.5 : *Showing the format of journal*

The first column in a journal is *Date* on which the transaction took place. In the *Particulars* column, the account title to be debited is written on the first line beginning from the left hand corner and the word 'Dr.' is written at the end of the column. The account title to be credited is written on the second line leaving sufficient margin on the left side with a prefix 'To'. Below the account titles, a brief description of the transaction is given which is called *Narration*. Having written the *Narration* a line is drawn in the Particulars column, which indicates the end of recording the specific journal entry. The column relating to *Ledger Folio* records the page number of the ledger book on which relevant account is appears. This column is filled up at the time of posting and *not* at the time of making journal entry.

The *Debit amount* column records the amount against the account to be debited and similarly the *Credit Amount* column records the amount against the account to be credited. It may be noted that, the number of transactions is very large and these are recorded in number of pages in the journal book. Hence, at the end of each page of the journal book, the amount columns are totaled and carried forward (c/f) to the next page where such amounts are recorded as brought forward (b/f) balances.

The journal entry is the basic record of a business transaction. It may be simple or compound. When only two accounts are involved to record a transaction, it is called a simple journal entry.

*For Example,* Goods Purchased on credit for Rs.30,000 from M/s Govind Traders on December 24, 2017, involves only two accounts: (a) Purchases A/c (Goods), (b) Govind Traders A/c (Creditors). This transaction is recorded in the journal as follows :

| Date | Particulars |  | L.F. | Debit | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | Amount | Amount |
|  |  |  |  | ` | ` |
| 2014 |  |  |  |  |  |
| Dec.24 | Purchases A/c | Dr. |  | 30,000 |  |
|  | To Govind Traders A/c |  |  |  | 30,000 |
|  | (Purchase of goods- in-trade from |  |  |  |  |
|  | Govind Traders) |  |  |  |  |

| Journal |
| --- |

It will be noticed that although the transaction results in an increase in stock of goods, the account debited is purchases, not goods. In fact, the goods account is divided into five accounts, viz. purchases account, sales account, purchases returns account, sales returns account, and stock account. When the number of accounts to be debited or credited is more than one, entry made for recording the transaction is called *compound* journal entry. That means compound journal entry involves multiple accounts. For example, Office furniture is purchased from Modern Furniture's on July 4, 2017 for ` 25,000 and ` 5,000 is paid by cash immediately and balance of ` 20,000 is still payable. It increases furniture (assets) by ` 25,000, decreases cash (assets) by ` 5,000 and increases liability by ` 20,000. The entry made in the journal on July 4, 2017 is :

# 3.5 The Ledger

The ledger is the principal book of accounting system. It contains different accounts where transactions relating to that account are recorded. A ledger is the collection of all the accounts, debited or credited, in the journal proper and various special journal (about which you will learn in chapter 4). A ledger may be in the form of bound register, or cards, or separate sheets may be maintained in a loose leaf binder. In the ledger, each account is opened preferably on separate page or card.

# *Utility*

A ledger is very useful and is of utmost importance in the organisation. The net result of all transactions in respect of a particular account on a given date can be ascertained only from the ledger. For example, the management on a particular date wants to know the amount due from a certain customer or the amount the firm has to pay to a particular supplier, such information can be found only in the ledger. Such information is very difficult to ascertain from the journal because the transactions are recorded in the chronological order and defies classification. For easy posting and location, accounts are opened in the ledger in some definite order. For example, they may be opened in the same order as they appear in the profit and loss account and in balance sheet. In the beginning, an index is also provided. For easy identification, in big organisations, each account is also allotted a code number.

*Format* of the account is shown in figure 3.6.

*Particulars* : Name of the item with reference to the original book of entry is written on debit/credit side of the account.

*Journal Folio* : It records the page number of the original book of entry on which relevant transaction is recorded. This column is filled up at the time of posting.

# *Distinction between Journal and Ledger*

The Journal and the Ledger are the most important books of the double entry mechanism of accounting and are indispensable for an accounting system. Following points of comparison are worth noting :

- 1. The Journal is the book of *first* entry (original entry); the ledger is the book of *second* entry.
- 2. The Journal is the book for *chronological* record; the ledger is the book for *analytical* record.
- 3. The Journal, as a book of source entry, gets greater importance as *legal evidence* than the ledger.
- 4. *Transaction* is the basis of classification of data within the Journal; *Account* is the basis of classification of data within the ledger.
- 5. Process of recording in the Journal is called Journalising; the process of recording in the ledger is known as *Posting*.

# *3.5.1 Classification of Ledger Accounts*

We have seen earlier that all ledger accounts are put into five categories namely, assets, liabilities, capital, revenues/gains and expense losses. All these accounts may further be put into two groups, i.e. permanent accounts and temporary accounts. All permanent accounts are balanced and carried forward to the next accounting period. The temporary accounts are closed at the end of the accounting period by transferring them to the trading and profit and loss account. All permanent accounts appears in the balance sheet. Thus, all assets, liabilities and capital accounts are permanent accounts and all revenue and expense accounts are temporary accounts. This classification is also relevant for preparing the financial statements.

# 3.6 Posting from Journal

Posting is the process of transferring the entries from the books of original entry (journal) to the ledger. In other words, posting means grouping of all the transactions in respect to a particular account at one place for meaningful conclusion and to further the accounting process. Posting from the journal is done periodically, may be, weekly or fortnightly or monthly as per the requirements and convenience of the business.

The complete process of posting from journal to ledger has been discussed below: *Step 1* : Locate in the ledger, the account to be debited as entered in the journal. *Step 2* : Enter the date of transaction in the date column on the debit side. *Step 3*: In the 'Particulars' column write the name of the account through which it has been debited in the journal. For example, furniture sold for cash ` 34,000. Now, in cash account on the debit side in the particulars column 'Furniture' will be entered signifying that cash is received from the sale of furniture. In Furniture account, in the ledger on the credit side is the particulars column, the word, cash will be recorded. The same procedure is followed in respect of all the entries recorded in the journal.

*Step 4* : Enter the page number of the journal in the folio column and in the journal write the page number of the ledger on which a particular account appears.

*Step 5* : Enter the relevant amount in the amount column on the debit side. It may be noted that the same procedure is followed for making the entry on the credit side of that account to be credited. An account is opened only once in the ledger and all entries relating to a particular account is posted on the debit or credit side, as the case may be.

We will now see how the transactions listed in example on *page 46-47* are posted to different accounts from the journal.
