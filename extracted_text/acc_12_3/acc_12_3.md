# Reconstitution of a Partnership Firm – Retirement/Death of a Partner 3

| œ |
| --- |

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

*After studying this chapter you will be able to:*

- *• calculate new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio of the remaining partners after the retirement/death of a partner;*
- *• describe the accounting treatment of goodwill in the event of retirement/ death of a partner;*
- *• make the necessary entries in respect of unrecorded assets and liabilities;*
- *• make necessary adjustment for accumulated profits or losses;*
- *• ascertain the retiring/ deceased partner claim against the firm and explain the mode of its settlement;*
- *• prepare the retiring partner's loan account, if required; and*
- *• prepare the deceased partner's executor's account in the case of death of a partner and the balance sheet of a reconstituted firm.*

Y ou have learnt that retirement or death of a partner also leads to reconstitution of a partnership firm. On the retirement or death of a partner, the existing partnership deed comes to an end, and in its place, a new partnership deed needs to be framed whereby, the remaining partners continue to do their business on changed terms and conditions. There is not much difference in the accounting treatment at the time of retirement or in the event of death. In both the cases, we are required to determine the sum due to the retiring partner (in case of retirement) and to the legal representatives (in case of deceased partner) after making necessary adjustments in respect of goodwill, revaluation of a assets and liabilities and transfer of accumulated profits and losses. In addition, we may also have to compute the new profit sharing's ratio among the remaining partners and so also their gaining ratio, This covers all these aspects in detail.

# 3.1 Ascertaining the Amount Due to Retiring/ Deceased Partner

The sum due to the retiring partner (in case of retirement) and to the legal representatives/ executors (in case of death) includes:

- (i) credit balance of his capital account;
- (ii) credit balance of his current account (if any);
- (iii) his share of goodwill;
- (iv) his share of accumulated profits (reserves);

(v) his share in the gain of revaluation of assets and liabilities;

- (vi) his share of profits up to the date of retirement/death;
(vii) interest on his capital, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death; and

(viii) salary/commission, if any, due to him up to the date of retirement/death. The following deductions, if any, may have to be made from his share:

- (i) debit balance of his current account (if any);
- (ii) his share of goodwill to be written off, if necessary;
- (iii) his share of accumulated losses;
- (iv) his share of loss on revaluation of assets and liabilities;
- (v) his share of loss up to the date of retirement/death;
- (vi) his drawings up to the date of retirement/death;

(vii) interest on drawings, if involved, up to the date of retirement/death. Thus, similar to admission, the various accounting aspects involved on retirement or death of a partner are as follows:

- 1. Ascertainment of new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio;
- 2. Treatment of goodwill;
- 3. Revaluation of assets and liabilities;
- 4. Adjustment in respect of unrecorded assets and liabilities;
- 5. Distribution of accumulated profits and losses;
- 6. Ascertainment of share of profit or loss up to the date of retirement/death;
- 7. Adjustment of capital, if required;
- 8. Settlement of the amounts due to retired/deceased partner;

### 3.2 New Profit Sharing Ratio

New profit sharing ratio is the ratio in which the remaining partners will share future profits after the retirement or death of any partner. The new share of each of the remaining partner will consist of his own share in the firm plus the share acquired from the retiring /deceased partner.

Consider the following situations :

(a) normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring or deceased partners in the old profit sharing ratio, and there is no need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them, as it will be same as the old profit sharing ratio among them. In fact, in the absence of any information regarding profit sharing ratio in which the remaining partners acquire the share of retiring/deceased partner, it is assumed that they will acquire it in the old profit sharing ratio and so share the future profits in their old ratio. For example, Asha, Deepti and Nisha are partners in a firm sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2:1. If Deepti retires, the new profit sharing ratio between Asha and Nisha will be 3:1, unless they decide otherwise.

(b) The continuing partners may acquire the share in the profits of the retiring/deceased partner in a proportion other than their old ratio, In that case, there is need to compute the new profit sharing ratio among them. *For example:* Naveen, Suresh and Tarun are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 5:3:2. Suresh retires from the firm and his share was

- 
required by Naveen and Tarun in the ratio 2:1. In such a case, the new share of profit will be calculated as follows:

New share of Continuing Partner = Old Share + Acquired share from the Outgoing Partner

Gaining Ratio 2 : 1

| Share acquired by Naveen | = | 2 | 3 of |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 3 | 10 |  |  |
|  | = | 2  | 3 | = | 2 |
|  |  | 3 | 10 |  | 10 |
|  |  | 1 | 3 |  |  |
| Share acquired by Tarun | = | of |  |  |  |
|  |  | 3 | 10 |  |  |
|  | = | 1  | 3 | = | 1 |
|  |  | 3 | 10 |  | 10 |
|  |  | 5 | 2 |  | 7 |
| Share of Naveen | = |  | + | = |  |
|  |  | 10 | 10 | 10 |  |
|  |  | 2 | 1 |  | 3 |
| Share of Tarun | = | + |  | = |  |
|  |  | 10 | 10 |  | 10 |

Thus, the new profit sharing ratio of Naveen and Tarun will be = 7 : 3.

(c) The contributing partners may agree on a specified new profit sharing ratio: In that case the ratio so specified will be the new profit sharing ratio.

#### 3.3 Gaining Ratio

The ratio in which the continuing partners have acquired the share from the retiring/deceased partner is called the gaining ratio. Normally, the continuing partners acquire the share of retiring/deceased partner in their old profit sharing ratio, In that case, the gaining ratio of the remaining partners will be the same as their old profit sharing ratio among them and there is no need to compute the gaining ratio, Alternatively, proportion in which they acquire the share of the retiring/deceased partner may be duly spacified. In that case, again, there is no need to calculate the gaining ratio as it will be the ratio in which they have acquired the share of profit from the retiring deceased partner. The problem of calculating gaining ratio arises primarily when the new profit sharing ratio of the continuing partners is specified. In such a situation, the gaining ratio should be calculated by, deducting the old share of each continuing partners from his new share i.e., new profit share minus old profit share, i.e., new profit share minus old profit share. For example, Amit, Dinesh and Gagan are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2.

Dinesh retires. Amit and Gagan decide to share the profits of the new firm in the ratio of 3:2. The gaining ratio will be calculated as follows :

  
$\text{Amit's Gaining Share}\qquad\quad=\;\dfrac{3}{5}-\dfrac{5}{10}=\dfrac{6-5}{10}=\dfrac{1}{10}$  
  
$\text{Gagan's Gaining Share}\qquad\quad=\;\dfrac{2}{5}-\dfrac{2}{10}=\dfrac{4-2}{10}=\dfrac{2}{10}$

Thus, Gaining Ratio of Amit and Gagan = 1:2

This implies Amit gains 1 3 and Gagan gains 2 3 of Dinesh's share of profit.

# Gaining share of Continuing Partner = New share – Old share

#### Do it Yourself

Distinguish between Gaining Ratio and Sacrificing Ratio in terms of:

- 1. Meaning
- 2. Effect on Partner's Share of Profit
- 3. Mode of calculation
- 4. When to calculate

#### *Illustration 1*

Madhu, Neha and Tina are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3:2. Calculate new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio if

- 1. Madhu retires
- 2. Neha retires
- 3. Tina retires.

#### *Solution*

Given old ratio among Madhu : Neha : Tina as 5 : 3 : 2

- 1. If Madhu retires, new profit sharing Ratio between Neha and Tina will be Neha : Tina = 3:2 and Gaining Ratio of Neha and Tina =3:2
- 2. If Neha retires new profit sharing Ratio between Madhu and Tina will be Madhu : Tina = 5:2

Gaining Ratio of Madhu and Tina = 5:2

- 3. If Tina retires, new profit sharing ratio between Madhu and Neha will be: Madhu : Neha = 5:3 Gaining ratio of Madhu and Neha = 5:3
#### *Illustration 2*

Alka, Harpreet and Shreya are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1. Alka retires and her share is taken up by Harpreet and Shreya in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio.

#### *Solution*

Gaining Given, Ratio of Harpreet and Shreya = 3:2 = 3 2 : 5 5 Old Profit Sharing Ratio of between Alka, Harpreet and Shreya 3:2:1 = 3 2 1 : : 6 6 6 Share acquired by Harpreet = 3 3 of 5 6 = 9 30 Share acquired by Shreya = 2 3 of 5 6 = 6 30 New Share = Old Share + Acquired Share Harpreet's New Share = 2 9 19 6 30 30 Shreya's New Share = 1 6 11 6 30 30 New Profit Sharing Ratio of Harpreet and Shreya = 19:11

### *Illustration 3*

Murli, Naveen and Omprakash are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3 1 , 8 2 and 1 8 . Murli retires and surrenders 2/3rd of his share in favour of Naveen and the remaining share in favour of Omprakash. Calculate new profit sharing and the gaining ratio of the remaining partners.

#### *Solution*

|  |  |  |  | Naveen |  | Omprakash |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Old Share |  |  | 1 |  |  | 1 |
|  |  |  |  | 2 |  |  | 8 |
| (ii) | Share Acquired by Naveen and |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | 2 3 |  | 1 | 3 1 of |  |
|  | Omprakash from Murli | = | 2 of |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | 3 8 | 8 | 3 | 8 | 8 |
|  | New Share = (i) + (ii) | = | 1 | 2 |  | 1 | 1 |
| (iii) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  | 2 | 8 |  | 8 | 8 |
|  |  |  | 6 | 3 | 2 |  | 1 |
|  |  | = | or |  | = | or |  |
|  |  |  | 8 | 4 | 8 |  | 4 |

Thus, the New profit sharing Ratio = 3 1 : 4 4 or 3:1, and the Gaining Ratio = 2 1 : 8 8 or 2:1 [as calculated in (ii)].

### *Illustration 4*

Kumar, Lakshya, Manoj and Naresh are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1 : 4. Kumar retires and his share is acquired by Lakshya and Manoj in the ratio of 3:2. Calculate new profit sharing ratio and gaining ratio of the remaining partners.

### *Solution*

|  |  |  | Lakshya |  | Manoj |  | Naresh |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (i) | Old Share |  | 2 |  | 1 |  | 4 |  |
|  |  |  | 10 |  | 10 |  | 10 |  |
| (ii) | Acquired Share from Kumar | 3 | 3 of | 2 | 3 of |  |  | Nil |
|  |  | 5 | 10 | 5 | 10 |  |  |  |
|  |  | = | 9 | = | 6 |  |  | Nil |
|  |  |  | 50 |  | 50 |  |  |  |
|  |  | 2 | 9 |  | 1 | 6 | 4 |  |
| (iii) | New share = (i) = (ii) |  |  | = |  |  | = |  Nil |
|  |  | 10 | 50 |  | 10 | 50 | 10 |  |
|  |  |  | 19 |  | 11 |  |  | 20 |
|  |  | = |  | = |  |  | = |  |
|  |  |  | 50 |  | 50 |  |  | 50 |

The New Profit Sharing Ratio is 19 : 11 : 20 Gaining ratio is 3 : 2 : 0

- *Notes :* 1. Since Lakshya and Manoj are acquiring Kumar's share of profit in the ratio of 3:2, hence, the gaining ratio will be 3:2 between Lakshya and Manoj.
	- 2. Naresh has neither sacrificed nor gained.

Ranjana, Sadhna and Kamana are partners sharing profits in the ratio 4:3:2. Ranjana retires; Sadhna and Kamana decided to share profits in future in the ratio of 5:3. Calculate the Gaining Ratio.

### *Solution*

| Gaining Share | = |  |  | New Share – Old Share |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sadhna's Gaining Share | = | 5 | 3   |  45 | 24 | = | 21 |

# 3.4 Treatment of Goodwill

The retiring or deceased partner is entitled to his share of goodwill at the time of retirement/death because the goodwill has been earned by the firm with the efforts of all the existing partners. Hence, at the time of retirement/death of a partner, goodwill is valued as per agreement among the partners the retiring/ deceased partner compensated for his share of goodwill by the continuing partners (who have gained due to acquisition of share of profit from the retiring/ deceased partner) in their gaining ratio.

The accounting treatment for goodwill in such a situation depends upon whether or, not goodwill already appears in the books of the firm.

## *3.4.1 When goodwill does not appear in the books*

When goodwill does not appear in the books of the firm, credit is given to the retiring partner for the share in goodwill by debiting the goodwill account to gaining partners capital accounts (individually) in their gaining ratio. The journal entry is :

Gaining Partners Capital A/c Dr. (Individually)

 To Retiring Partners Capital A/c (Share in goodwill of retiring partner adjusted)

Let us take an example to understand the treatment of goodwill.

A, B and C are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1 B retired and the value of goodwill of the firm in valued at Rs. 60,000. A and C continue the business sharing profits in the ratio of 3:1. The journal entry for adjustment of goodwill will be :

| A's Capital A/c | Dr. | 15,000 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C's Capital A/c | Dr. | 5,000 |  |
| To B's Capital A/c |  |  | 20,000 |

(B's share of goodwill adjusted to remaining partners' capital accounts in their gaining ratio)

It may also happen that as a result of decision on the new profit sharing ratio among the remaining partners, a continuing partner may also sacrifice a part of his share in future profits. In such a situation his capital account will also be credited along with the retiring/deceased partner's capital account in proportion to his sacrifice and the other continuing partners' capital accounts will be debited based on their gain in the future profit ratio.

Keshav, Nirmal and Pankaj are partners sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 4 : 3 : 2. Nirmal retires and the goodwill is valued at Rs. 72,000. Keshav and Pankaj decided to share future profits and losses in the ratio of 5 : 3. Record necessary journal entries.

## *Solution*

|  | Pankaj's Capital A/c | Dr. |  | 11,000 |  |
|  | To Nirmal's Capital A/c |  |  |  | 24,000 |
|  | (Nirmal's share of goodwill adjusted to Keshav |  |  |  |  |
|  | and Pankaj in their gaining ratio of 13:11) |  |  |  |  |

*Working Notes*

- 1. Vimal's share of goodwill = Rs. 72,000 3 9 = Rs. 24,000 2. Calculation of Gaining Ratio Gaining Share = New Share – Old Share Keshav's Gaining Share = 5 4 13 8 9 72 Pankaj's Gaining Share = 3 2 11 8 9 72 Hence, Gaining Ratio between Keshav and Pankaj is 13:11 i.e. 13 11 : . 24 24

*Working Notes*

- 1. Jaya's Share of Goodwill
* [10] R. 36, 000 x = Rs. 12, 000

- 2. Calculation of Gaining Ratio Gaining Share = New Share – Old Share
Kirt's Gain = $\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{2-1}{6}=\frac{1}{6}$  
  
Ekta's Gain = $\frac{1}{3}-\frac{2}{6}=\frac{2-2}{6}=\frac{0}{6}$ (Neither Gain nor Sacrifice)

Shewata's Gain = 1 1 2 1 1 3 6 6 6 

Hence, Gaining ratio between Kirti and Shewata 1 1 : 6 6 = 1:1

Deepa, Neeru and Shilpa were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5 : 3 : 2. Neeru retired and the new profit sharing ratio between Deepa and Shilpa was 2 : 3. On Neeru's retirement, the goodwill of the firm was valued at Rs. 1,20,000. Record necessary journal entry for the treatment of goodwill on Neeru's retirement.

| (Shilpa compensated Neeru for her share of |  |  |  |
| goodwill and to Deepa for the sacrifice made |  |  |  |
| by her on Neeru's retirement) |  |  |  |

*Working Notes*

1. Calculation of Gaining Ratio Gaining Share = New Share – Old Share

Deepa's Gaining Share = $\frac{2}{5}-\frac{5}{10}=\frac{4-5}{10}=-\frac{1}{10}=\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)$ i.e., Sacrifice.  
  

Shilpa's Gaining Share = 3 2 6 2 4 5 10 10 10 i.e., Gain

- 2. Hence, Shilpa will compensate both Neeru (retiring partner) and Deepa (continuing partner who has sacrificed) to the extent of their sacrifice worked out as follows: Deepa's Sacrifice = Goodwill of the firm Sacrificing Share
= Rs. 1,20,000 $ \times\frac{1}{10}$ = Rs. 12,000 $ \times$ .

### Books of Hanny and Sunny Journal

*Working Notes*

(i) Pammy's share of current value of goodwill 1 3 of Rs. 84,000

* 84,000 $\times$ = Rs. 28,000

- (ii) Gaining Share = New Share Old Share Hanny's Gaining Share = 2 3 1 3 6 6
Sunny's Gaining Share = 1 1 1 3 6 6 

This gaining Ratio of Hanny and Sunny is 1 1 : 6 6 1:1

# *3.4.2 Hidden Goodwill*

If the firm has agreed to settle the retiring or deceased partner's account by paying him a lump sum amount, then the amount paid to him in excess of what is due to him, based on the balance in his capital account after making necessary adjustments in respect of accumulated profits and losses and revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc., shall be treated as his share of goodwill (known as hidden goodwill). For example, P, Q and R are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1. R retires, and the balance in his capital account after making necessary adjustments on account of reserves, revaluation of assets and liabilities workout to be Rs. 60,000, P and Q agreed to pay him Rs. 75,000 in full settlement of his claim. It implies that Rs. 15,000 is R's share of goodwill of the firm. This will be debits to the capital accounts of P and Q in their gaining ratio (3:2 assuming no change in their own profit sharing ratio) and crediting R's capital Account as follows:

|  |  | Rs. | Rs. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P's Capital A/c | Dr. | 9,000 |  |
| Q's Capital A/c | Dr. | 6,000 |  |
| To R's Capital A/c |  |  | 15,000 |
| (R's share of goodwill adjusted in P's |  |  |  |
| and Q's capital accounts in their |  |  |  |
| gaining ratio of 3:2) |  |  |  |

# 3.5 Adjustment for Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities

At the time of retirement or death of a partner there may be some assets which may not have been shown at their current values. Similarly, there may be certain liabilities which have been shown at a value different from the obligation to be met by the firm. Not only that, there may be some unrecorded assets and liabilities which need to be brought into books. As learnt in case of admission of a partner, a Revaluation Account is prepared in order to ascertain net gain (loss) on revaluation of assets and/or liabilities and bringing unrecorded items into firm's books and the same is transferred to the capital account of all partners including retiring/deceased partners in their old profit sharing ratio. the Journal entries to be passed for this purpose are as follows:

| 1. | For increase in the value of assets |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Assets A/c's (Individually) | Dr. |

## 3.6 Adjustment of Accumulated Profits and Losses

Sometimes, the Balance Sheet of a firm may show accumulated profits in the form of general reserve and/on accumulated losses in the form of profit and loss account debit balance. The retiring/deceased partner is entitled to his/her share in the accumulated profits and is also liable to share the accumulated losses, if any. These accumulated profits or losses belong to all the partners and should be transferred to the capital accounts of all partners in their old profit sharing ratio. The following journal entries are recorded for the purpose.

- (i) *For transfer of accumulated profits (reserves),* Reserves A/c Dr. To All Partners' Capital A/c's (Individually) (Reserves transferred to all partners' capital account's in old profit sharing ratio). (ii) *For transfer of accumulated losses* All Partners' Capital A/c's (Individually) Dr. To Profit and Loss A/c (Accumulated loss transferred to all partners' capital accounts in their old profit-sharing ratio)
*For example;* Inder, Gajender and Harinder are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1. Inder retires and the Balance Sheet of the firm on that date was as follows:

# When Partner Retires in the Middle of the Year

Normally retirement of a partner takes place at the end of accounting period. But there can be a case where a partner decides to retire in the middle of the year. In such a case the claim shall include share of profit or loss, interest on capital, interest on drawings if any, from the date of last balance sheet to the date of retirement. Here, the main problem relates to the calculation of profit for the intervening period, i.e., the period from the date of last balance sheet and the date of retirement. Let us understand by way of example:

Maira, Shabnam and Vipul were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5:4:1 profits for the year ending on March 31, 2019 was Rs. 1,00,000.

Vipul decides to retire on June 30, 2019. The new profit sharing ratio of the firms is 1:1. Vipul's share of profit for the period of from April 01 to June 30, 2019 shall be calculated as:

Total profit for the year ending on 31st March, 2017 = Rs. 1,00,000 Vipul's share of profit:

Proceeding Year's × Proportionate Period × Share of Deceased Partner

= Rs. 1,00,000 $\times$ 3 4 12 10 = Rs. 10,000

The journal entry will be recorded as follows:

| Profit & Loss Suspense A/c | Dr. 10,000 |
| --- | --- |
| To Vipul's Capital A/c | 10,000 |

Vipul's share of profit transferred to his capital account

Alternatively, if Vipul's share of profit was to be calculated on the basis of average profits of the last three years, to which were Rs. 1,36,000 for 2016–17, Rs. 1,54,000 for 2017–18 and Rs. 1,00,000 for 2018–19, Vipul's share of profit for the period from April 7, 2019 to June 30, 2019 shall be calculated on the basis of average profit based on profits for the last year calculated as follows:

Total Profit Rs.1,36,000+Rs.1,54,000+Rs.1,00,000 Average Profit = No. of Years 3 Rs.3,90,000 Rs.1,30,000 3 Vipul's share of Profit Rs.3,90,000 Rs.1,30,000 3 = Rs. 13,000 The Journal entry will be: Profit and Loss Suspense A/c 13,000

To Vipul's Capital A/c 13,000

In case, the agreement provides, that share of profit of the retiring partner will be worked out on the basis of sales, and it is specified that the sales during the pear 2018-19 were Rs. 8,00,000 and the sales from April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2019 were Rs. 1,50,000 Vipul's share of profits for the period from April 1, 2019 shall be calculated as follows:

| If sale is Rs. 80,00,000, the profit | = | Rs. 1,00,000 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| If sale is Rs. 1, the profit | = | 1,00,000 |  |
|  |  | 8,00,000 |  |
| If sale is Rs. 1,50,000, the profit | = | 1,00,000  1,50,000 |  |
|  |  | 8,00,000 |  |
| Vipul's share of profit | = = | Rs. 18,750 |  |
|  |  | Rs. 7,500 |  |
| Profit & Loss Suspense A/c | Dr. | 75,00 |  |
| To Vipul's Capital A/c |  |  | 75,00 |

For being retiring partners share of profit for the intervening period to books of account, the following journal entry is recorded.

- (i) Profit & Loss Suspense A/c Dr. To Retiring Partners Capital A/c (Share of profit for intervening/period)
Later, Profit and Loss suspense account is closed by transferring the amount to the gaining partners capital account in their gaining ratio. The journal entry is:

- (ii) Gaining Partners Capital A/c Dr. (in gaining ratio) To Profit & Loss Suspense A/c Alternatively, the following journal entry can also be passed in place of (i) or (ii) Gaining Partners Capital A/c Dr. To Retiring partners Capital A/c (Share of profit of retiring partner credited)
### 3.7 Disposal of Amount Due to Retiring Partner

The outgoing partner's account is settled as per the terms of partnership deed i.e., in lumpsum immediately or in various instalments with or without interest as agreed or partly in cash immediately and partly in instalment at the agreed intervals. In the absence of any agreement, Section 37 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 is applicable, which states that the outgoing partner has an option to receive either interest @ 6% p.a. till the date of payment or such share of profits which has been earned with his/her money (i.e., based on capital ratio). Hence, the total amount due to the retiring partner which is ascertained after all adjustments have been made is to be paid immediately to the retiring partner. In case the firm is not in a position to make the payment immediately, the amount due is transferred to the retiring Partner's Loan Account, and as and when the amount is paid it is debited to his account. The necessary journal entries recorded are as follows.

- 1. *When retiring partner is paid cash in full.* Retiring Partners' Capital A/c Dr. To Cash/Bank A/c 2. *When retiring partners*' *whole amount is treated as loan.* Retiring Partners' Capital A/c Dr. To Retiring Partners' Loan A/c 3. *When retiring partner is partly paid in cash and the remaining amount treated as loan.* Retiring Partners' Capital A/c Dr. (Total Amount due) To Cash/Bank A/c (Amount Paid) To Retiring Partners' Loan A/c (Amount of Loan)
- 4. When Loan account is settled by paying in instalment includes principal and interest.

| b) For payment of instalment |  |

*Note:*

- 1. The balance of the retiring partner's loan account is shown on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet till the last instalment is paid to him/her.
- 2. Entry number (a) and (b), above will be repeated till the loan is paid off.

# 3.8 Adjustment of Partners' Capitals

At the time of retirement or death of a partner, the remaining partners may decide to adjust their capital contributions in their profit sharing ratio. In such a situation, the sum of balances in the capitals of continuing partners may be treated as the total capital of the new firm, unless specified otherwise. Then, to ascertain the new capital of the continuing partners, the total capital of the firm is divided amongst the remaining partners as per the new profit sharing ratio, and the excess or deficiency of capital in the individual capital account's may be worked out. Such excess or shortage shall be adjusted by withdrawal of contribution in cash, as the case may be, for which the following journal entries will be recorded.

- (i) For excess capital withdrawn by the partner :
Partners' Capital A/c Dr. To Cash / Bank A/c

- (ii) For amount of capital to be brought in by the partner:
Cash / Bank A/c Dr. To Partners' Capital A/c

Consider the following situations:

The adjustment of the continuing partner's capitals may involve any one of the three ways as illustrated as follows :

1. When the capital of the new firm as decided by the partners is specified.

# *Illustration 14*

Mohit, Neeraj and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 2 : 1 : 1. Neeraj retires and Mohit and Sohan decided that the capital of the new firm will be fixed at Rs. 1,20,000. The capital accounts of Mohit and Sohan show a credit balance of Rs. 82,000 and Rs. 41,000 respectively after making all the adjustments. Calculate the actual cash to be paid off or to be brought in by the continuing partners and pass the necessary journal entries.

# *Solution*

The New Profit Sharing Ratio between Mohit and Sohan = 2 : 1

|  | Mohit | Sohan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New Capital based new ratio is | 80,000 | 40,000 |

Asha, Deepa and Lata are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1. Deepa retires. After making all adjustments relating to revaluation, goodwill and accumulated profit etc., the capital accounts of Asha and Lata showed a credit balance of Rs. 1,60,000 and Rs. 80,000 respectively. It was decided to adjust the capitals of Asha and Lata in their new profit sharing ratio. You are required to calculate the new capitals of the partners and record necessary journal entries for bringing in or withdrawal of the necessary amounts involved.

## *Solution*

| a. Calculation of new capitals of the existinging partners |  |
| --- | --- |
| Balance in Asha's Capital (after all adjustments) | = 1,60,000 |
| Balance in Lata's Capital | = 80,000 |
| Total Capital of the New Firm | = 2,40,000 |
| Based on the new profit sharing ratio of 3:1 |  |
| 3 × Asha's New Capital = Rs. 2,40,000 = 1,80,000 |  |
| 4 |  |
| 1 |  |
| × Lata's New Capital = Rs. 2,40,000 = 60,000 |  |

### 3.9 Death of a Partner

As stated earlier, the accounting treatment in the event of death of a partner is similar to that in case of retirement of a partner, and that in case of death of a partner his claim is transferred to his executors and settled in the same manner as that of the retired partner. However, there is one major difference that, while the retirement normally takes place at the end of an accounting period, the death of a partner may occur any time. Hence, in case of a partner, his claim shall also include his share of profit or loss, interest on capital, interest on drawings (if any) from the date of the last Balance Sheet to the date of his death of these, the main problem relates to the calculation of profit for the intervening period (i.e., the period from date of the last balance sheet and the date of the partner's death. Since, it is

considered cumbersome to close the books and prepare final account, for the period, the deceased partner's share of profit may be calculated on the basis of last year's profit (or average of past few years) or on the basis of sales.

For example, Bakul, Champak and Darshan were partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5:4:1. The profit of the firm for the year ending on March 31, 2017 was Rs.1,00,000. Champak died on June 30, 2017. Bakul and Darshan decided to share profits equally. Champak's share of profit for the period from April 1 to June 30, 2017, shall be calculated as follows:

Total profit for the year ending on 31st March, 2017 = Rs.1,00,000

Champak's share of profit :

Proceeding Year's Profit × Proportionate Period × Share of Deceased Partner

= Rs. 1,00,000 $ \times$ $ \frac{3}{12}$ $ \times$ $ \frac{4}{10}$= Rs. 10,0000.  

The journal entry will be recorded as follows :

Profit & Loss Suspense A/c Dr. 10,000

To Champak's Capital A/c 10,000

(Champak's share of profit transferred to his capital account)

Alternatively, if Champak's share of profit was to be calculated on the basis of average profits of the last three years, which were Rs. 1,36,000 for 2014-15, Rs. 1,54,000 for 2015-16 and Rs. 1,00,000 for 2016-17; Champahs share of profit for the period from April 7, 2017 to June 30, 2017 shall be calculated on the basis of average profit based on profits for the last year calculation as follows:

Total Profit Average Profit = No. of years = Rs. 1,36,000 + Rs. 1,54,000 + Rs. 1,00,000 3 = 3 Rs. 3,90,000 = Rs. 1,30,000 Champak's share of profit = 12 3 months 4 Rs. 1,30,000 months 10 × × = Rs. 13,000 The Journal entry will be: Profit & Loss Suspense A/c Dr. 13,000 To Champak's Capital A/c 13,000

In case, the agreement provides, that share of profit of the deceased partner will be worked out on the basis of sales, and it is specified that the sales during the year 2015-16 were Rs. 8,00,000 and the sales from April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 were Rs. 1,50,000 Champak's share of profits for the period from April 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 shall be calculated as follows.

| If sale is Rs.8,00,000, the profit | = Rs.1,00,000 |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| If sale is Rs.1, the profit | 1,00,000 = |  |  |  |
|  | 8,00,000 |  |  |  |
| If sale is Rs.1,50,000, the profit | 1,00,000 × 1,50,000 = |  |  |  |
|  | 8,00,000 |  |  |  |
|  |  | = Rs. 18,750 |  |  |
| Champak's share of profit | = Rs. 7,500 |  |  |  |
| The Journal entry will be: |  |  |  |  |
| Profit & Loss Suspense A/c | Dr. |  | 2,500 |  |
| To Champak's Capital A/c |  |  |  | 7,500 |

For being deceased partner's share of profits for the intervening period to books of account, the following journal entry is recorded.

- (i) Profit and Loss (Supense) A/c Dr. To Deceased Partner's Capital A/c (Share of profit for the intervening period)
Later Profit and Loss Suspense account is closed by transferring the account to Gaining Partners' Capital Account in their gaining ratio. The journal entry is:

- (ii) Gaining Partners Capital A/c [In gaining ratio] To Profit and Loss Suspense A/c (P&L Suspense account transferred).
Alternatively the following journal entry can also be passed in Place of (i) & (ii)

- (ii) Gaining Partners' Capital A/c Dr. To Deceased Partner Capital A/c (share of profit of Deceased Partner credited)
