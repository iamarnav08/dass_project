Adolescents in different situations experience a wide range of emotions that could vary from positive to negative, such as, happiness, satisfaction, sadness, anger, frustration, etc. They have high expectations from themselves that may be further reinforced by people and environment around them. This may cause stress in them. There are many occasions when they may get stressed or feel angry or frustrated. It is natural for adolescents to experience both positive and negative emotions. It is also necessary to express their feelings and emotions. There are positive and negative ways of expressing the emotions. It is pointed out that negative emotions and their expression in negative ways may be caused by certain stresses experienced by the adolescents.

In today's life, stress is becoming a major cause of many health-related problems. It is a known fact that chronic stress negatively affects health. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac problems, depression, anxiety attacks, road-rage, etc., have become common now-a-days. The most common emotion faced by all of us during this COVID-19 pandemic is fear. It has also made us panicky and anxious to deal with such issues. Yoga can help us in dealing with stress and mental health issue during this time. In the management of stress, lifestyle plays an important role. A healthy lifestyle reduces stress and promotes one's health.

Here, it is important to recognise that stress can be tackled and definitely decreased. Many times, we may not necessarily be in control of the situations but we can control our over-all response to such situations.

# **What is Stress?**

Stress can be understood as a state of physiological and psychological imbalance resulting from demanding or difficult situations which the person is not able to cope with.

In day-to-day life, a person faces many situations. Some situations are easy to handle; while some are difficult. As a result, the body starts responding at physiological and psychological levels. At the physiological level, there may be changes in heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, secretions of hormones, etc. At the psychological level, there may be changes in attention, concentration, memory and alertness and also in the emotional state (like anger, fear, hate, sadness, etc.).

Stress generally occurs as a result of major events in life, such as, tough competitions, getting low scores in an examination, recent break-up in friendship, not getting a good job, a fight with others, and so on. There are several other factors which may cause stress in a person, like, diseases, poor living conditions, poverty, problems in relationship, challenges of adolescence, wrong habits, high aspirations, unrealistic goals, death of a close relative, discrimination, fast changing life and many others. However, sometimes it may also occur due to minor issues, such as, not getting up early, not getting ready on time, reaching school late, not getting the desired food, arguments with a friend, not getting permission from parents for attending a late night party, and so on.

Intensity of stress varies from person to person and generally depends on perception of a particular situation by that person. A situation may be easy to handle for one person, while it may pose a big challenge to another. For example, examination may cause stress in one student, while it may not affect another student.

Stress which motivates us to perform better and learn new skills is beneficial. For example, getting admission in a new course, preparing for an examination or getting promotion may cause stress but this stress is beneficial as it finally contributes towards growth and development. Stress may be harmful also. When stress is severe and chronic it reduces efficiency of a person. This kind of stress may adversely affect our ability to feel, think and act.

During severe stress, people may become restless and worried. They may not remember the things properly. Even small things may make them angry. You also might have observed that when you are in tension you become restless. You may not be able to focus on your studies and small things may cause irritation.

Chronic and severe stress reduces our body's ability to fight diseases. It can lead to various psychosomatic diseases, such as, peptic ulcer, migraine, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, etc. It could even result in heart attack, brain stroke and death. Several psychological disorders, such as, anxiety attacks and depression may

# **Activity 8.1**

Think and discuss the following with your friends:

#### **Questions**

- **•** Have you ever experienced stress?
- **•** What was the cause of it?
- **•** How did you manage it?
- **•** Can you think any other way by which you could have better managed it?

134

Chap-8_New.indd 134 8/24/2020 11:42:31 AM

also result from chronic and severe stress. However, the fact is — we cannot avoid stress. Therefore, management of stress is necessary

# **Yoga as a Way of Life for Stress Management**

Yoga has been considered a panacea for managing the stress. In this context, we will discuss the role of yoga in developing a healthy lifestyle by which stress can be managed. Yoga practices when become a way of life, play an important role in stress management.

You have learnt about *asana*, *pranayama*, *kriya*, *mudra*, *bandha* and meditation in Class IX. However, yoga is not limited to the physical postures, breathing techniques or meditation for a few minutes only. Rather yoga is a way of life also. It propounds several principles and practices, such as, *asana, pranayama, kriya, mudra, bandha* and meditation which are relevant to healthy living. Yogic principles and practices of healthy living can be adopted by all, irrespective of age, gender, profession or place. As a way of life, yoga gives direction about food, eating habits, thinking, recreational means and conduct. Yogic way of life, if adopted in true sense, empowers us to deal with stress and promote physical and mental health.

The components of yogic way of life are —

- **•** *Ahara* (Food)
- **•** *Vihara* (Relaxation)
- **•** *Achara* (Conduct)
- **•** *Vichara* (Thinking)
- **•** *Vyavahara* (Behaviour or actions)

#### *Ahara*

The principles of *ahara* are related to food consumption. Yoga emphasises on *mitahara,* which is related to quality and quantity of food and also the state of mind during the intake of food.

As for the quality, the concept of *mitahara* implies that food should be freshly cooked, nutritious, nourishing and in the natural form. Regarding quantity of food, *mitahara* mentions that two quarters of the stomach should be filled with food, one quarter with liquid and the remaining quarter (one‑fourth) should be left empty for free flow of air. This implies that quantity of food may vary from person to person depending upon the individual requirements. It is very natural that a sportsperson will require more food as compared to a person who is doing desk job. *Mitahara* also advocates that the food should be eaten with positive state of 135

Chap-8_New.indd 135 8/24/2020 11:42:31 AM

mind with utmost concentration. You might have observed if someone eats while watching the television or in an angry mood or when the person's attention is somewhere else, then they tend to just gulp down the food without enjoying it. So, the state of mind is also very important while eating. Thus, *mitahara* emphasises that right quality and quantity of food should be eaten in a positive state of mind.

# **Activity 8.2**

In Column I, put a list of food items that you like eating and in Column II put the food items that you consider good for your health.

| Column I | Column II |
| --- | --- |
| Food items that you like eating | Food items that you consider good for health |

#### **Questions**

- **•** Compare the items of both the columns. Do the items in Column I tally with those in Column II?
- **•** Do you think that you need to change your food habits? Make a separate list indicating which food items from the list (Column I) you want to change.

# *Vihara*

*Vihara* means relaxation, which can be brought about by activities, such as, exercise, recreational and creative activities like drawing, painting, singing, etc. These activities help to regulate and channelise our emotions and bring us joy and happiness. Yogic practices of *asana, pranayama* and *meditation* relax body and mind. In addition to this, relaxation can be attained in good company also. Sound sleep is also important for relaxation. It is, therefore, important that we should regularly follow a timetable that provides adequate time for yogic and creative activities which are relaxing.

# **Activity 8.3**

Prepare a timetable that allots some leisure time to pursue your hobbies and creative activities, exercise and sufficient time for sleep.

|  | Time allocated | Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • | 5.30 to 6.30 pm | • Yogasana |
| • | _________________________ | • _________________________ |
| • | _________________________ | • _________________________ |

136

Chap-8_New.indd 136 8/24/2020 11:42:31 AM

# *Achara*

*Achara* means conduct that includes emotions, attitudes, desires, instincts and habits. Right conduct is essential for a stress-free life. Positive emotions and positive attitudes, good habits and control on desires help in making us strong, both, individually and socially. The right conduct protects us from unnecessary stress caused by negative emotions and attitudes like hate, jealousy, fear, etc.

Therefore, we should have control on our desires, instincts, emotions, habits and attitudes. Here, yoga is important as it encourages good conduct in our personal and social life. Yoga advocates for positive emotions and positive attitude towards self and other persons.

In this context yogic principles of *Yama* (restraint) and *Niyama* (observance) help to develop control on our desires and emotions and bring about peace and harmony.

#### *Yama* **(Restraint) and** *Niyama* **(Observance)**

*Yamas* (restraints) and *Niyamas* (observances) are sets of the dos and the don'ts. They can be considered as the universal codes of conduct that help us in following high standards in our personal and social life. *Yamas* are concerned with one's social life; while the *niyamas* are concerned with one's personal life. *Yama* and *Niyama* are part of *Ashtanga* Yoga that has been propagated by Patanjali.

The **five** *yamas* are *ahimsa* (non-violence), *satya* (truthfulness), *asteya* (non stealing), *brahmcharya* (celibacy) and *aparigraha* (non possessiveness).

The **five** *niyamas* are: *Shaucha* (cleanliness), *Santosha* (contentment), *Tapas* (austerity), *Swadhyaya* (self study) and *Ishwarpranidhana* (surrender to god).

#### *Vichara*

We know that thoughts are very important as our behaviour is guided by the kind of thoughts we have. Our thinking should be positive.

Positive thoughts bring pleasure to our life; while negative thoughts can make us unhappy. Right thinking guides us towards appropriate behaviour. It helps in prevention and management of stress-related health problems.

Yoga prescribes that one should have positive thoughts. Positive thoughts give us strength to bear the sorrows of life. Yogic practices like *yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana* (meditation), study of good literature, etc., help us in controlling our thoughts and thereby promoting optimism in life.

#### **Activity 8.4**

Ramesh and his friends are planning to skip their classes and go for a movie instead. Ramesh is worried as he feels that it is not right to skip the class without informing his parents. But at the same time, he does not want to be seen as a spoilsport by his friends. Finally, he succumbed to the peer pressure. Now, he is disturbed to think what would happen if his parents come to know of it.

#### **Questions**

- **•** Why was Ramesh worried?
- **•** Was his conduct appropriate? Explain your answer.
- **•** Can you suggest some ways to get out of this conflicting situation?
- **•** What would you do, if you were in Ramesh's place?
- **•** Do you think the yogic principles of *Yama* (restraint) and *Niyama* (observance) help to develop control on our desires and emotions and lessen our stress?

Her parents are worried as they think that she has been wasting her time and energy on futile, trivial and useless things. One day, her parents asked her to study while she wanted to finish the novel which she was reading. At this, Shreya lost her temper and started shouting at her parents.

#### **Questions**

- **•** Was Shreya's behaviour towards her parents appropriate?
- **•** Were her attitude and thinking responsible for this kind of behaviour?
- 138 **•** Suggest how she should have behaved.

# *Vyavahara*

*Vyavahara* (behaviour) means actions. *Vyavahara* is the result of *ahara*, *vihara, achara and vichara*. Yogic philosophy propounds that our actions should be right. We should not indulge in wrong activities. Our behaviour towards others should be appropriate. *Karma‑ yoga* proposes that we should perform right and act with full dedication and to our utmost capacity without worrying about the results. We can remain stress-free and be happy if we follow this philosophy and act accordingly.
