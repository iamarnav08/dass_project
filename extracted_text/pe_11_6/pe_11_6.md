Yoga is a science of living. It needs to be incorporated in daily life. It works on physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual levels of human beings. Yoga helps in improving the quality of life. For example, yoga teaches us how to think, behave and grow to become a fully mature person. Yoga brings harmony between body and mind. It is an art and science for healthy living.

The word 'yoga' is derived from the Sanskrit word 'yuj' meaning to join, to yoke, and to unite. It is an ancient system of self-development and natural process of evolution of human beings.

Now a days, the word yoga has a strong impact on human life. The ultimate purpose of yoga is the attainment of human growth. Yoga has been established as a new field in education system. It helps in achieving higher state of consciousness on the evolution of an individual's development. It is the discipline of body and mind.

Children face too much stress in their surroundings, such as, school, home, playground, etc. Due to this stress they have many problems such as physical, mental and emotional. When these health hazards create problems for long, they lead to psychosomatic diseases and social unrest. All these problems originate due to imbalance between our physical, mental and spiritual levels. They are closely related to materialistic way of life. Attachment and endless ambitions are the two primary causes of our sufferings.

According to the Upanishads, yoga is a higher state of consciousness and a process to ease the mind and manifest the wisdom. Yoga establishes the activities of a healthy state of body, mind and harmonious interpersonal relationships. Due to unhealthy lifestyle, the overall growth of child gets ceased and it leads to ill health. Yoga works on various

# **History and Development of Yoga**

Yoga has a very long history and in terms of legacy it is as old as human civilisation. Its history is also linked with the *vedas*  and *upanishads*.

Yoga had a special place during the Indus Valley Civilisation (2000 B.C). The stone seals restored from the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation depict the practice of Yoga during old days.

The word yoga is frequently referred in all the four *Vedas Rigveda, Yujurveda, Samveda* and *Atharvaveda*.

*Moksha* is the ultimate goal of yoga, which is well explained in the *Upanishads*. The teaching of Buddha (*Arya Asthangic Marga*) and Jainism (five great vows) are the two pillars of yoga tradition. These two had greatly contributed to the development of yoga.

**The epics:** *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* have numerous references about yoga. The *Bhagavad Gita* is considered as a classical treatise on yoga.

There is also description of Yoga in *Shad Darshans.*

*Maharishi* Sage Patanjali had codified the comprehensive system of Yoga around second century B.C. Patanjali gave the concept of eight limbs of yoga called as *Ashtang Yoga*.

Nath culture also played an important role in the development of the *Hatha* Yoga Tradition. *Hatha* Yoga deals with day-to-day health related problems and emphasised on the human body and mind. The famous scriptures of *Hatha*  Yoga are *Hatha Yoga Pradeepika*, *Gheranda Samhita*, *Hatha Ratnavali*, *Shiva Samhita*, *Siddha Siddhanta Paddhati,* etc. Nineteenth century gurus, such as, Ramakrishna Parmahansa, Swami Vivekananda, Maharishi Aurobindo and Ramana Maharishi preached yoga to the masses.

# **Schools of Yoga**

The basic goal of yoga is thus to attain bliss and also to provide true knowledge about human beings. In order to attain the above goals, various thoughts, ideas and opinions were given by seers which are known as the schools of yoga. These are—

## *Karma* **Yoga (Path of Action)**

*Karma* Yoga is one of the main streams of yoga. *Karma*  literally means action. The aim of *Karma* Yoga is attaining union with the higher-self by harmonising the actions.

*Fig. 6.3: Swami Vivekanand*

Karma Yoga inspires the person to perform the work to the best of their abilities without any attachment or expectation of the results. The concept of *Karma* Yoga and its practice are mentioned in the *Bhagavad Gita*. This stream of yoga emphasises the following.

- **•** *Karma* **as duty:** Karma Yoga lays emphasis on doing karma or action as duty. When an act is performed dutifully with total involvement, it leads to joy and happiness.
- **•** *Karma Sukaushalam***:** *Karma* Yoga states that yoga means a skilled action. Actions should be done efficiently. Actions performed with full concentration and detachment brings efficiency.
- **•** *Nishkama Karma***:** *Nishkama Karma* means action which is free from personal motives and is performed as a duty. This attribute emphasises that actions should be performed without any expectations of the results.

## *Jnana* **Yoga (Path of Knowledge)**

- **•** *Jnana* Yoga is related to the knowledge of 'self', the world and realisation of ultimate reality or truth. *Jnana* Yoga, thus is a path of philosophy that uses intellect and helps to gain knowledge and keeps the person away from *avidya*.
- **•** *Avidya* (ignorance) is the main cause of pain, misery and sufferings in life. A person because of *avidya*  (ignorance) identifies himself with various names, and forms such as body, mind, race and nationality, etc., and remains in pursuit of worldly possessions. This knowledge develops discriminating knowledge (*Viveka*) that will help to remove the veil of *avidya*, enables the one to discriminate between reality and unreality (appearance) and guides towards the path of real happiness and bliss.
- **•** The main aim of the *Jnana* Yoga, thus is to overcome the *avidya* (ignorance) so that one can understand and distinguish between the real and unreal. The three important stages of *Jnana* Yoga are *shravan*  (adequate hearing), *Manana* (constant remembrance) and *Nidhidhyasana* (contemplation or meditation).

## *Raja* **Yoga (Path of Psychic Control)**

- **•** The science of *Raja* Yoga proposes a practical and scientific method of reaching the truth. *Raja* Yoga, the path of psychic control is a systematic process of culturing the mind.

- **•** It is aimed to develop dormant potential of the personality.
- **•** *Raja* Yoga discusses the way of controlling and modification of mind (*chittavrittis*).
- **•** *Abhyasa* (continuous practice) and *viaragya*  (detachment) are also emphasised in *Raja* Yoga for the control of *chittavrittis* and spiritual practices.
- **•** *Raja* Yoga is based on *Ashtanga* Yoga (eight limbed Yoga) as propounded by Maharishi Patanjali.
- **•** All the eight limbs of yoga work on various levels of human personality.

## *Bhakti* **yoga (Path of Devotion)**

- **•** *Bhakti* Yoga (path of devotion) is a systematic method of engaging the mind in the practice of divine love. *Bhakti* means selfless and unconditional love to god. This mode of worship consists of unending and loving remembrance of God. The person merges himself/ herself with the God.

# *Pranayama*

Chap-6.indd 242 31-07-2020 15:28:56

the control over autonomic respiratory mechanisms through breathing patterns that generate energy and enhance emotional stability. Some of the breathing practices are mentioned here.

# **Phases of** *Pranayama***:** *Puraka, Rechaka* **and**  *Kumbhaka*

- **•** *Puraka***:** In *puraka*, inhalation is very gentle and deep with full awareness. This helps the chest to expand more in its clavicular (upper) region, coastal (middle and lower) region, from front to back and also sideways. This expansion creates more inner space allowing more inflow of air into lungs. At the same time, diaphragm contracts more and moves down towards abdominal cavity to the maximum. In this process, muscles of the front wall in abdominal cavity and the perineal region are under pressure to move outwards and downwards respectively.
- **•** *Kumbhaka* means retention of breath inside or outside. *Kumbhaka* performed along with bandhas (*Mulabandha, Uddiyanabandha* and *Jalandharbandha*) helps in the process of metabolism and assists in more efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Through regulated breathing, *Kumbhaka* ensures sufficient supply of oxygen and thus helps the brain to work efficiently.
- **•** *Rechaka***:** *Rechaka* assists in more efficient releasing of carbon dioxide. The duration of *rechaka* is supposed to be double of *puraka*. The process of *rechaka* starts at the end of *kumbhaka*, when *bandhas* are released. In the process of *rechaka*, diaphragm is pushed upwards towards the cavity of chest making the chest to contract. Slow and prolonged exhalation prescribed for *rechaka*  helps in completely pushing the carbon dioxide out of lungs.
