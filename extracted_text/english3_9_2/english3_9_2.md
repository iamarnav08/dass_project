### **Text I**

#### **Role of Music in Life**

Today, we are rushing through life and everyone seems to be pressurised and stressed about one or the other thing. Stress has become an inescapable part of our lives. Many of our illnesses are a result of stress, and to deal with it, we need certain ways to relax our body and mind. Listening to music, particularly gentle, calming and melodious music, relaxes people both physically and mentally. Music releases

> endorphins, the natural painkillers in our brain, which relieve us from the sense of pain. Music can normalise heart rate and blood pressure. The common occurrences of fatigue and boredom decrease when we listen to music. It diverts our attention from everyday anxieties, thereby reducing the stress caused by such concerns. While meditating, listening to music helps us to connect with our soul. Students can improve their concentration and boost their memory by listening to soft music. Soothing music, when played at night, helps us to rest and relax for a good night's sleep. Listening to good music helps in overcoming negative traits such as anger or worry, thereby improving our personality. It creates positive energy and happiness. Every cell in the body becomes energetic with increased peace of mind.

> Music is a therapy for everyone — plants, birds, animals and human beings — to flourish and rejuvenate. It certainly plays an important part in making the world better for all living beings.

## **Notes Text II**

#### **Beating the Odds**

The musical accomplishments of composer Ludwig van Beethoven have been all the more remarkable for the fact that he lost his hearing ability from an early age. He developed the symptoms of tinnitus, a constant sound of ringing in his ears that made it difficult for him to hear. He is compared to Mozart for his genius, and is considered the most eminent musician after Mozart.

Although his formal education never went beyond the elementary level, he trained in music under Joseph Haydn. He has always been acclaimed as a brilliant piano maestro. His father and grandfather were the court musicians of a German prince. Young Ludwig was often made to perform for his father's drinking companions in the middle of the night, and was even beaten if he protested.

For the first thirty years of his life, Beethoven could listen to and play music effortlessly. As a result, he understood sounds of musical instruments and the pitch of the singing voices. He knew the harmony between music and singing before he became completely deaf. His deafness was not sudden, but a gradual decline. This slow process of losing his

> hearing activated his mind to imagine how his compositions would sound like. When he became completely deaf, he started to observe the vibrations of the piano. The observations helped him realise that he could not hear the high notes of the piano. To be able to hear his own compositions, he sawed off the legs of his piano. The piano touched the floor, and Beethoven would press his ear to the floor, banging the piano keys to listen to the high notes in his compositions.

> The most significant aspect of Beethoven's character was that he did not give up. With a brave heart, he confronted the greatest challenge

*beating the odds:* to succeed despite not having a good chance of succeeding

![](_page_3_Picture_11.jpeg)

Unit 2.indd 24 30-05-2018 11:41:15

a musician can face, and continued living his dream of composing music. Deafness could not deter him from achieving the pinnacle of musical success. He fought against the greatest obstacle and won.

His quality of 'never giving up' strengthened him. It made him come to terms with his deafness in a dynamic and constructive way. These qualities led him to become a famous composer.

- 1. Read the following statements and write true (T) or false (F).
	- (a) Although he composed a lot of music, Beethoven never learned to play music himself. (T/F)
	- (b) His deafness was not a sudden loss of hearing. (T/F)
	- (c) He composed most of his music early in his life, before he became deaf. (T/F)
	- (d) His musical skills were compared to Haydn. (T/F)
	- (e) Beethoven cut down the legs of his piano to hear the notes of the keys from the floor. (T/F)

Read the poem carefully and answer the question that follows.

## **the solitaRy ReapeR**

Behold her, single in the field, Yon solitary Highland lass! Reaping and singing by herself; Stop here, or gently pass! Alone she cuts and binds the grain, And sings a melancholy strain; O listen! for the Vale profound Is overflowing with the sound.

> No Nightingale did ever chaunt More welcome notes to weary bands Of travellers in some shady haunt, Among Arabian sands: A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird, Breaking the silence of the seas Among the farthest Hebrides.

Will no one tell me what she sings? Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow For old, unhappy, far-off things, And battles long ago: Or is it some more humble lay, Familiar matter of to-day? Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain, That has been, and may be again?

# **Grammar**

'Er' is used for the comparative degree for shorter words and 'more' is used for longer words.

**Example:**

#### **Music as a Therapy**

 "Rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul", rightly said by Plato. Music is often referred to as 'food' for the soul due to the several benefits we can derive from experiencing it.

Music can be pleasure for some, and a way to relax for others. It also motivates and energises listeners. Music is, indeed, a universal language, which can bring nations together and unite people with different faiths as it touches one's soul. In the mainstream, music is mainly known for its entertainment quotient, but the Indian culture also talks about the healing effects of music through 'Raga Chikitsa'. *Raga Chikitsa* has helped in reviving an ancient healing practice known as *Nada Yoga*.

*Nada* is a musical sound, which is believed to have curative effects on the body and soul of all creatures. Consequently, its power is therapeutic and is used in curing diseases. Medical research has found music therapy to aid patients in pain management. It is not surprising, as music affects the body and mind significantly.

One experiences positive energy by listening to music. Music lifts one from clouds of desolation. Rhythms, *desolate:* giving an impression of bleak and dismal emptiness

*sedative:* promoting calm or inducing sleep

**Notes** particularly upbeat music, helps one distract oneself from situations that cause stress and brightens one's mood. Music lowers anxiety levels, relaxes mind and brings optimism. It is said that listening to soft, sedative music once a day can help overcome depression.

> Music therapy finds its traces in mythology. The story of Hippocrates, the Greek father of medicine dates back to 400 B.C. He is known to have used music to cure his patients. This therapy also aids stroke victims to heal at a faster rate, since it increases the patient's emotional comforts and motivates them to move towards the path of recovery. On the other hand, adolescents, too, are benefitted by music in terms of emotional, social and psychological well being. Music is a force that purifies beings from within.

> According to you, which FOUR of the following statements are true?

- (a) *Nada Yoga* treats diseases through *Raga Chikitsa*.
- (b) Music is a universal language that reaches souls.
- (c) Music therapy dates back to 400 B.C.
- (d) Hippocrates played music to treat the patients.
- (e) Upbeat tunes help stroke victims recover faster.
- (f) Music helps adolescents to discover their identity.

# **Speaking**

- Thyagaraja : Yes, I believe music surely has a positive effect on people's lives. It helps when you are stressed, or depressed about something. Apart from these, music is a good way of relaxing and feeling good about life.
