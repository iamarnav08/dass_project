H aving understood how a company raises its capital, we have to learn the nature, objectives and types of financial statements it has to prepare including their contents, format, uses and limitations. The financial statements are the end products of accounting process. They are prepared following accounting policies consistently accounting standards prescribed in the Companies Act and accounting concepts, principles, procedures and also the legal environment in which the business organisations operate. These statements are the outcome of the summarising process of accounting and are, therefore, the sources of information on the basis of which conclusions are drawn about the profitability and the financial position of a company. Hence, they need to be arranged in a proper form with suitable contents so that the shareholders and other users of financial statements can easily understand and use them in their economic decisions in a meaningful way.

# 3.1 Meaning of Financial Statements

Financial statements are the basic and formal annual reports through which the corporate management communicates financial information to its owners and various other external parties which include investors, tax authorities, government, employees, etc. These refer to: the balance sheet (position statement) as at the end of accounting period, the statement of profit and loss of a company and the cash flow statement.

#### **3.2 Nature of Financial Statements**

The chronologically recorded facts about events expressed in monetary terms for a defined period of time are the basis for the preparation of periodical financial statements which reveal the financial position as on a date and the financial results obtained during a period. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants states the nature of financial statements as, "the statements prepared for the purpose of presenting a periodical review of report on progress by the management and deal with the status of investment in the business and the results achieved during the period under review. They reflect a combination of recorded facts, accounting principles and personal judgements".

The following points explain the nature of financial statements:

- 1. *Recorded Facts:* Financial statements are prepared on the basis of facts in the form of cost data recorded in accounting books. The original cost or historical cost is the basis of recording transactions. The figures of various accounts such as cash in hand, cash at bank, trade receivables, fixed assets, etc., are taken as per the figures recorded in the accounting books. The assets purchased at different times and at different prices are put together and shown at costs. As these are not based on market prices, the financial statements do not show current financial condition of the concern.
- 2. *Accounting Conventions:* Certain accounting conventions are followed while preparing financial statements. The convention of valuing inventory at cost or market price, whichever is lower, is followed. The valuing of assets at cost *less* depreciation principle for balance sheet purposes is followed. The convention of materiality is followed in dealing with small items like pencils, pens, postage stamps, etc. These items are treated as expenditure in the year in which they are purchased even though they are assets in nature. The stationery is valued at cost and not on the principle of cost or market price, whichever is less. The use of accounting conventions makes financial statements comparable, simple and realistic.
- 3. *Postulates:* Financial statements are prepared on certain basic assumptions (pre-requisites) known as postulates such as going concern postulate, money measurement postulate, realisation postulate, etc. Going concern postulate assumes that the enterprise is treated as a going concern and exists for a longer period of time. So the assets are shown on historical cost basis. Money measurement postulate assumes that the value of money will remain the same in different periods. Though there is drastic change in purchasing power of money, the assets purchased at different times will be shown at

the amount paid for them. While, preparing statement of profit and loss the revenue is included in the sales of the year in which the sale was undertaken even though the sale price may be received over a number of years. The assumption is known as realisation postulate.

- 4. *Personal Judgements:* Under more than one circumstance, facts and figures presented through financial statements are based on personal opinion, estimates and judgements. The depreciation is provided taking into consideration the useful economic life of fixed assets. Provisions for doubtful debts are made on estimates and personal judgements. In valuing inventory, cost or market value, whichever is less is being followed. While deciding either cost of inventory or market value of inventory, many personal judgements are to be made based on certain considerations. Personal opinion, judgements and estimates are made while preparing the financial statements to avoid any possibility of over statement of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure, keeping in mind the convention of conservatism.
Thus, financial statements are the summarised reports of recorded facts and are prepared the following accounting concepts, conventions, accounting policies, accounting standards and requirements of Law.

# **3.3 Objectives of Financial Statements**

Financial statements are the basic sources of information to the shareholders and other external parties for understanding the profitability and financial position of any business concern. They provide information about the results of the business concern during a specified period of time in terms of assets and liabilities, which provide the basis for taking decisions. Thus, the primary objective of financial statements is to assist the users in their decision-making. The specific objectives include the following:

- 1. *To provide information about economic resources and obligations of a business:* They are prepared to provide adequate, reliable and periodical information about economic resources and obligations of a business firm to investors and other external parties who have limited authority, ability or resources to obtain information.
- 2. *To provide information about the earning capacity of the business:* They are to provide useful financial information which can gainfully be utilised to predict, compare and evaluate the business firm's earning capacity.
- 3. *To provide information about cash flows:* They are to provide information useful to investors and creditors for predicting, comparing and evaluating, potential cash flows in terms of amount, timing and related uncertainties.
- 4. *To judge effectiveness of management:* They supply information useful for judging management's ability to utilise the resources of a business effectively.
- 5. *Information about activities of business affecting the society:* They have to report the activities of the business organisation affecting the society, which can be determined and described or measured and which are important in its social environment.
- 6. *Disclosing accounting policies:* These reports have to provide the significant policies, concepts followed in the process of accounting and changes taken up in them during the year to understand these statements in a better way.

# **3.4 Types of Financial Statements**

The financial statements generally include two statements: balance sheet and statement of profit and loss which are required for external reporting and also for internal needs of the management like planning, decision-making and control. Apart from these, there is also a need to know about movements of funds and changes in the financial position of the company. For this purpose, a cash flow statement is prepard.

Every company registered under The Companies Act 2013 shall prepare its balance sheet, statement of profit and loss and notes to account thereto in accordance with the manner prescribed in the revised Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 to harmonise the disclosure requirement with the accounting standards and to converge with new reforms.

|  | ( of Rs. 40,000) |  |  |  |

#### Notes to Accounts

#### **Important points:**

- Preliminary expenses are to be written-off completely in the year in which such expenses are incurred. They should be written-off first from securities premium and the balance if any, from statement of profit & loss.
- Borrowing costs such as discount on issue of debentures should be written-off in the same year in which debuntures are issued.

#### **Share application money pending allotment**

Share application money not exceeding the issued capital and to the extent non-refundable shall be classified as non-current. It will be shown on this face of balance sheet as share application money pending allotment.

#### **Borrowings**

Total borrowings are categorised into long-term borrowings, short-term borrowings and current maturities to long-term debt.

- (i) Loans which are repayable in more than twelve months/operating cycle are classified as long-term borrowings on the face of balance sheet.
- (ii) Loans repayable on demand or whose original tenure is not more than twelve months/operating cycle are classified as short-term borrowings on the face of balance sheet.

- (iii) Current maturities to long-term loan include amount repayable within twelve months/operating cycle under other current liabilities with Note to Account.
**Deferred tax assets/liabilities** are always non-current. This is in accordance with Schedule III of the Companies Act.

# **Trade payables**

Sundry creditors have been replaced with the term Trade payables and are classified as current and non-current. Trade payables to be settled beyond 12 months from the date of balance sheet or beyond the operating cycle are classified under "other long-term liabilities" with Note to Account. For example, purchase of goods and services in normal course of business. The balance of trade payables are classified as current liabilities on the face of balance sheet.

# **Proposed Dividend**

Proposed dividend is proposed by the Board of Directors and declared (approved) by the shareholders in their Annual General Meeting. Board of Directors propose the dividend after the annual accounts for the year have been prepared. Annual General Meeting of the shareholders is held thereafter meaning it is held in the next financial year.

Shareholders may reduce the amount of proposed dividend but cannot increase it. Since declaration of proposed (final) dividend is contingent upon shareholders approval, Proposed dividend is shown as contingent liability.

AS-4, Contingencies and Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date prescribes that proposed dividend will be shown in the Notes to Accounts.

After the Proposed dividend is declared by the shareholders, it becomes a liability for the company and is accounted in the books. As a consequence, proposed dividend of previous year will be declared (approved) by the shareholders in the current year and this declared (approved) proposed dividend will be accounted during the year. Proposed dividend for the current year will be relevant for the next financial year.

Briefly, proposed dividend of previous year will be accounted in the current year after it is declared (approved) by the shareholders in their annual general meeting.

# **Provisions**

The amount of provision settled within 12 months from balance sheet date or within operating cycle period from date of its recognition is classified as short term provisions and shown under current liabilities on the face of balance sheet. Others are depicted as long-term provisions under non-current liabilities on the face of balance sheet.

# **Fixed assets**

There is no change in the treatment of fixed assets. Both tangible and intangible assets are non-current. This may also be noted if the useful life of the asset is less than 12 months, it will still fall under non-current.

# **Investments**

Investments are also classified into current and non-current categories. Investments expected to realise within twelve months are considered as current investments under current assets. Others are classified as non-current investments under non-current assets. Both are however shown on the face of the balance sheet.

# **Inventories**

All inventories are always treated as current.

# **Trade receivables**

Trade receivables realised beyond twelve months from reporting date/ operating cycle starting from the date of their recognition are classified as "Other non-current assets" under the head non-current assets with Note to Accounts. For example, sale of goods or services rendered in normal course of business. Others are classified as current assets and shown on the face of the balance sheet.

# **Cash and cash equivalent**

It is always current however, amounts which qualify as cash and cash equivalents as per AS-3 is shown here. The supremacy is accorded to AS over Schedule III, cash and cash equivalents are to the disclosed in accordance to the prescribed standard.

# **3.5 Uses and Importance of Financial Statements**

The users of financial statements include management, investors, shareholders, creditors, government, bankers, employees and public at large. Financial statements provide the necessary information about the performance of the management to these parties interested in the organisation and help in taking appropriate economic decisions. It may be noted that the financial statements constitute an integral part of the annual report of the company in addition to the directors report, auditors report, corporate governance report, and management discussion and analysis.

The various uses and importance of financial statements are as follows:

- 1. *Report on stewardship function:* Financial statements report the performance of the management to the shareholders. The gaps between the management performance and ownership expectations can be understood with the help of financial statements.
- 2. *Basis for fiscal policies:* The fiscal policies, particularly taxation policies of the government, are related with the financial performance of corporate undertakings. The financial statements provide basic input for industrial, taxation and other economic policies of the government.
- 3. *Basis for granting of credit:* Corporate undertakings have to borrow funds from banks and other financial institutions for different purposes. Credit granting institutions take decisions based on the financial performance of the undertakings. Thus, financial statements form the basis for granting of credit.
- 4. *Basis for prospective investors:* The investors include both short-term and long-term investors. Their prime considerations in their investment decisions are security and liquidity of their investment with reasonable profitability. Financial statements help the investors to assess longterm and short-term solvency as well as the profitability of the concern.
- 5. *Guide to the value of the investment already made:* Shareholders of companies are interested in knowing the status, safety and return on their investment.

The financial statements enable the Stock brokers to judge the financial position of different concerns and take decisions about the prices to be quoted.

# **3.6 Limitations of Financial Statements**

Though utmost care is taken in the preparation of the financial statements and provide detailed information to the users, they suffer from the following limitations:

- 1. *Do not reflect current situation:* Financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical cost. Since the purchasing power of money is changing, the values of assets and liabilities shown in financial statement do not reflect current market situation.
- 2. *Assets may not realise:* Accounting is done on the basis of certain conventions. Some of the assets may not realise the stated values, if the liquidation is forced on the company. Assets shown in the balance sheet reflect merely unexpired or unamortised cost.
- 3. *Bias:* Financial statements are the outcome of recorded facts, accounting concepts and conventions used and personal judgements made in different situations by the accountants. Hence, bias may be observed in the results, and the financial position depicted in financial statements may not be realistic.
- 4. *Aggregate information:* Financial statements show aggregate information but not detailed information. Hence, they may not help the users in decision-making much.
- 5. *Vital information missing:* Balance sheet does not disclose information relating to loss of markets, and cessation of agreements, which have vital bearing on the enterprise.
- 6. *No qualitative information:* Financial statements contain only monetary information but not qualitative information like industrial relations, industrial climate, labour relations, quality of work, etc.
- 7. *They are only interim reports:* Statement of Profit and Loss discloses the profit/loss for a specified period. It does not give an idea about the earning capacity over time similarly, the financial position reflected in the balance sheet is true at that point of time, the likely change on a future date is not depicted.

#### *Summary*

*Financial Statements:* Financial statements are the end products of accounting process, which reveal the financial results of a specified period and financial position as on a particular date. Financial Statements are prepared and published by corporate undertakings for the benefit of various stakeholders. These statements include Statement of profit and loss and balance sheet. The basic objective of these statements is to provide information required for decisionmaking by the management as well as other outsiders who are interested in the affairs of the undertaking.

*Balance Sheet:* The balance sheet shows all the assets owned by the concern, all the obligations or liabilities payable to outsiders or creditors and claims of the owners on a particular date. It is one of the important statements depicting the financial position or status or strength of an undertaking.

*Statement of Profit and Loss:* The Statement of profit and loss is prepared for a specific period to determine the operational results of an undertaking. It is a statement of revenue earned and the expenses incurred for earning the revenue. It is a performance report showing the changes in income, expenses, profits and losses as a result of business operations during the year between two balance sheet dates.

*Significance of Financial Statements:* The users of financial statements include Shareholders, Investors, Creditors, Lenders, Customers, Management, Government, etc. Financial statements help all the users in their decision-making process. They provide data about general purpose needs of these members.

*Limitations of Financial Statements:* Financial statements are not free from limitations. They provide only aggregate information to satisfy the general purpose needs of the users. They are technical statements understood by only persons having some accounting knowledge. They reflect historical information but not current situation, which is essential in any decision making. In addition, one can get idea about the organisation's performance in terms of quantitative changes but not in qualitative terms like labour relations, quality of work, employees satisfaction, etc. The financial statements are neither complete nor accurate as the flow of income and expenses are segregated using best judgement apart from accepted concepts. Hence, these statements need proper analysis before their use in decisionmaking.
