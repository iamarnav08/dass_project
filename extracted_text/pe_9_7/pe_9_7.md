# **7.2 Basketball**

You may have played basketball or have seen this game being played. Basketball is one of the world's most popular game. It is a fast, free-flowing, high-scoring team game. The players throw a ball in a basket horizontally positioned to score points while following a set of rules. Two teams play on a marked rectangular court with a basket at each end. The rules allow all players to move freely around the court and occupy any position on the court. All players get an equal opportunity to score basket. The way in which the game is re-started after a point is scored or a rule infringement makes it a fast game with few breaks in between regulation timing. To play this game, students should learn and practise the basic skills of ball dribbling, passing, receiving and shooting. Game of basketball involves neuromuscular coordination and often tall players are preferred.

# **7.2.1 History**

The game of basketball was originated at the Springfield College of Physical Education Massachusetts, USA in 1891 by Dr James Naismith. In 1894 Naismith drew up the first 13 rules, which still form the basis of modern basketball rules. In India, the YMCA at Kolkata introduced basketball some 80 years ago. Later the YMCA established at Chennai in 1920 played an important role in the development of this game. Now-a-days basketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools and colleges. The game is played by both men and women of all ages and abilities.

1950. At the same time every state in India had formed a State Basketball Association. The first National Basketball event was held in Delhi in 1934, every two years till 1951 and there after it became an annual feature.

#### **7.2.2 How to Play Basketball**

- • Basketball is played on a rectangular court, which could be an indoor wooden court or an outdoor concrete court. Basketball court dimensions are 28× 15 metres. The court is divided into two sections, called half-courts, by the mid-court line, where the game starts with a jumpball. A jumpball is when a referee throws the ball up at centre circle to determine which team gets possession. Two players from opposing teams jump up to tip the ball, in the hope that one of them will secure the ball.
- • The duration of the game of each quarter is ten minutes with 2 minute rest between first and second quarters and third and fourth quarters. Between second and third quarters the rest is 15 minutes. The duration of extra time is five minutes. Teams exchange courts in each quarter. The clock is stopped while the play is not active.

Chapter-7 Team Games indd.indd 82 18-11-2016 4:39:17 PM

A team may consist of not more than twelve members, including a captain. But only five players from each team are on the court at one time. Substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped.

The team with the ball, attempting to score is called 'on offense'. The team defending from scoring is called 'on defense'. The ball is moved in two ways: dribbling and passing to teammates. If the ball goes out of bounds, due to the offensive player/team, the possession is given back to the defensive team. This is a form of penalty, which results in the loss of a possession of ball.

Both men and women wear, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey vest with a clearly visible number, printed on both the front and back. Players wear high top sneakers that provide extra ankle support.

The game is monitored by the officials consisting of the referee, one or two umpires and five table officials. The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each team scoring, timekeeping, and individual and team fouls, player substitutions, alternating possession arrow, and stop–and-goclock.

**Equipments –** Essential equipments in a basketball game are: the ball, clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, whistle and clock systems.

**Fouls –** An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul. Players who are fouled either get ball possession or are awarded one or more free throws, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket. Each player is allowed five fouls before they are rejected from the game and cannot come back.

# **Activity 7.2**

Observe a basketball match and identify different forms of shooting.

# **Activity 7.3**

Set shot illustration is given in Fig.7.5 Collect photographs of other forms of shooting from various sources books, magazines etc. and discuss with your classmates.

**• Dribbling** – If you have seen any basketball game you might have observed that players bounce the ball between the dribbling hand and playing surface. This action of continuous bouncing is called dribbling. If dribbling is done on the spot, it is called stationary dribbling. You might have also noticed that players perform varied actions while dribbling. The variations are cross over dribbling that is changing of dribbling hand at the front side, reverse dribbling that is taking 180 degree turn from rear side and changing the direction, behind the back dribbling that is taking the ball from back side and bounce it on another side.

**• Passing and receiving** (Fig. 7.4) – While playing a basketball game, you need to transfer the ball from one player to another. Transfer of possession of the ball is called passing and a player who receives the ball is known as receiver. There are different types of passing namely–chest pass, overhead pass, bounce pass, baseball pass, hook pass and behind the back pass etc.

**• Shooting** (Fig. 7.5) – You might have observed that a player has to throw the ball into basket of the opponent team to win the game. Therefore, each team should make an attempt to score by throwing the ball in different forms of shooting such as two-hand set shot, one-hand set shot, lay up shot, jump shot and hook shot etc.

- **• Rebounding** (Fig. 7.6) Whenever a player makes an attempt to score the basket and if it is missed then the ball will rebound from over the ring or board.
- **• Individual Defence** (Fig. 7.7) While playing basketball if a team loses the possession of the ball, immediately player has to turn to individual defence. For a good defence, following factors are important (i) location of the player (ii) guarding distance (iii) movement (iv) vision and (v) footwork.

# **7.3 Cricket**

You might have seen a cricket match being played in your school or on the television. Also you might have yourself played this game with your friends. This is a bat and ball game played between two teams on a field. In the centre of the field is a rectangular pitch. One team bats, trying to defend the wicket and scoring as many runs as possible. The other team bowls and fields, trying to dismiss the batsmen and thus limiting the runs scored by the batting team. Run can be scored by the striking batsman hitting the ball with the bat, running to the opposite end of the pitch and touching the crease there without being dismissed. The teams switch between batting and fielding at the end of an inning. In general this game is very popular.

#### **7.3.1 History**

The origin of the game of Cricket was gradual. The Hambeldon Club which was founded in about 1750

had played a significant part in the evolution of the game. It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C) with its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became an international game with the formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference (I.C.C) in 1909. The name of Imperial Cricket Conference was changed to International Cricket Conference (later, Council) to enable countries outside the Commonwealth to become its members. Earlier only test matches were played where each team played two innings in five or lesser days. First One day International match was played in 1971 with limitations of overs per inning. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and staged the first

limited over Cricket World Cup in 1975. In the 21st century, a new limited over form, Twenty20 and more recently IPL (Indian Premier League), has made an immediate impact.

Cricket was brought to India by the British. An England team toured India in 1902-03. An All-India team went on a tour of England in 1911 under Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. The Indian Cricket Control Board came into being towards the end of 1928. India entered the international arena and played its first official Test against England in 1932. Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singh of Nawanagar who had gone to England for further studies, made a remarkable name for himself in the game of cricket. He is generally acknowledged as the Father of Indian Cricket although he played only in England. He will always be remembered through the National Cricket Championship known as Ranji Trophy.

#### **7.3.2 How to play Cricket**

- • A cricket match is played between two teams of eleven players each.
- • The match is divided into periods called Innings. During an Inning, one team fields and the other bats. The two teams switch between fielding and batting after each Inning.
- • All eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time. The fielding team's eleven members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field.
- • Behind each batsman is a target called a wicket. One designated member of the fielding team, called the bowler, is given a ball, and he attempts to deliver (bowl) the ball. If the bowler succeeds in hitting the wicket (Fig. 7.9), or if the ball, after being struck by the batsman, is caught by the fielding team before it touches the ground, the batsman is out.
- • If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and the ball is not caught before it hits the ground, the two batsmen may then try to score runs for their team by running across the pitch. Each crossing and grounding by both batsmen is worth one run. The batsmen may attempt multiple runs or select not to run at all.
- • If the batsman hits the bowled ball over the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team scores six runs. If the ball touches the ground and then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four runs.

Chapter-7 Team Games indd.indd 86 18-11-2016 4:39:22 PM

- • The inning is complete when 10 of the 11 members of the batting team have been dismissed, one always remaining "not out", or when a set number of "overs" has been played.
- • Field with positions in cricket are shown in Fig. 7.10

#### **7.3.3 Field and Equipments**

The wickets should be pitched opposite and parallel to each other at a distance of 20.12 m between the centre of the two middle stumps. The stumps stand 70 cm tall and each bail is 11.1cm in length.
- • The bowling crease is marked in line with the stumps at each end and is 2.64 m in length.
- • The bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or "balls") and each set of six balls is called an "over". When six balls have been bowled, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can bowl unchanged at the same end for several overs.

![](_page_7_Figure_6.jpeg)

- • Two umpires are appointed one on each end (bowlers end and strikers end) to monitor the game. There is also a third umpire for play review. The umpire's decision during a game is final in all matters.

# **7.7 Kho-Kho**

Kho-Kho is one of the popular indigenous games of India and is an inexpensive sport like kabaddi because it does not require much equipment. Many historians are of the view that the game of Kho-Kho is a modified version of 'Run and Chase'. In ancient era, a version of the Kho-Kho game was played on *raths* or chariots in Maharashtra. This was known as Rathera.

First sets of Kho-Kho rules were framed in the earlier part of 1900. A committee was constituted by the Gymkhana, Pune in 1914 for framing the Kho-Kho rules and the first Kho-Kho rule book was published in 1924 by Gymkhana, Baroda.

#### **7.7.1 Kho-Kho Play Field – Equipment and facilities**

• Match shall consist of two innings of 36 minutes, each innings has two turns of nine minutes with an interval of five minutes.

# **7.7.3 Fundamental Skills**

These can be classified into two types — chasing and running skills.

*Chasing Skills*

• Giving Kho – a member of the team which is chasing gives kho by lightly touching his teammate on the back and says "Kho". (Fig. 7.28)

• After receiving kho a chaser should take the first step in the direction in which she/he wants to go.

• The chaser after reaching the pole holds the post with one hand and with strongly holding the feet on the ground. She/he moves body forward as far as possible to touch a runner with the other hand. This skill is also called pole dive (See Fig. 7.29).

• When an active runner touches by extending an arm, it is called trapping.

• Chaser can bounce or dive to touch a runner if she/he feels that she/he can do so. A dive can be of the following types — sitting dive, turning dive, running dive, pole dive and side dive.

Chapter-7 Team Games indd.indd 100 18-11-2016 4:39:31 PM

#### *Techniques of Getting up*

- • These techniques can be monkey crawl, standing or both.
- • In monkey crawl, both hands should touch the ground without the body weight falling on them. Torso should be parallel to the ground. Eyes should watch the runner's feet but the head should not be lifted up. In this, the chaser can use any method to touch the runner.
- • In the standing style, the chaser gets up slowly while turning the shoulder and then decides the direction to be taken to chase the runner.

#### *Techniques of sitting in a square*

There are two techniques namely the toe method and the paralled toe method.

- • In toe method, the players sit in the square keeping feet apart with one foot ahead of the other. The player shall sit with the support of the hands spread out.
- • In parallel toe method, the chaser sits in the square and the feet are kept parallel to each other. Hands are placed outside the centre lane and fingers form a bridge. The knees are kept bent and parallel to each other.

#### *Running Skills*

- • The runners come in batches of three and take up scattered positions on the court.
- • In chain, the runner runs in a zig-zag manner from one post to the other. When the player runs around two chasers in a zig-zag manner from one post to the other, it is called a double chain.

# **7.8.3 How to Play Volleyball**

There are two teams comprising 12 players each.

The referee does the toss to decide upon who chooses to serve first or select the side. If a deciding set is to be played, a new toss will be carried out. After the toss only six players from each team including the **Libero** start playing the game.

- • Free Zone is five metres from the side lines and eight metres from the end lines.
- • All lines are five cm wide, light in colour and different from the colour of the floor.
- • Attack line is three metres away from the centre line, marks the front zone. Attack line is extended by the addition of broken lines from sidelines.
- • Front Zone is limited by the axis of the centre line and the rear edge of the attack line. The front zone is considered to extend beyond the sidelines to the end of the free zone.

- • **Consequences of winning a rally –** A rally is the sequence of playing actions from the moment of the service hit by the server until the ball is out of play. If the serving team wins a rally, it scores a point and continues to serve; if the receiving team wins a rally, it scores a point and gets right to serve.
- • **To win a set –** A set (except the deciding fifth set) is won by the team which first scores 25 points with a minimum lead of two points. In the case of a tie, i.e. 24 each, play is continued until a two-point lead is achieved (e.g., 26–24; 27–25).

and players' positions, throughout the set. When the receiving team has gained the right to serve, its players rotate one position clock-wise: the player in position 2 rotates to position 1 to serve, the player in position 1 rotates to position 6, etc.

- • **Rotational Fault –** A rotational fault is committed when the service is not made according to the rotation order. As a result the team loses rally and a point.
#### **7.8.4 Fundamental Skills**
