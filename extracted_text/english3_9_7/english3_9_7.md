You have read about Santosh Yadav, the youngest woman in the world to have conquered Mount Everest in 1992. You must have heard or read about Poorna, who at the age of 13 years 11 months, became the youngest girl in the world to have scaled the Mount Everest in 2014, with sheer determination and willpower. You would have also read about Maria Sharapova who bagged the Women's Singles crown at Wimbledon in 2004. She was determined, tough, competitive, hard-working with unwavering desire. Both of them had big dreams from the very young age.

### **Reading Comprehension**

Read the following passage carefully. Based on your reading, answer the following questions in the space provided.

### **Text I**

On 3 August 1996, Leander Paes became the first Indian to win an individual medal in 44 years when he defeated Fernando Meligeni of Brazil in an exciting match in the Centennial Olympic Games at Atlanta. Paes ranked 31 places below the Brazilian, played with gusto and determination against a player who has two ATP tour titles under his belt, and clinched the bronze medal. He was given a standing

*gusto:* enjoyment and enthusiasm

Unit 7.indd 96 20-02-2023 09:25:57

ovation when Paes raised his hand in triumph and said a silent prayer.

Leander's father had won a bronze medal in the Munich Olympics 1972 as a member of the Indian hockey team. It is creditable to Leander Paes as he got it in an individual event.

Later he dedicated the medal to his coach and his doubles teammate. "They have helped me out and given me advice and kept me in good frame of mind. This medal doesn't just show my efforts; it shows the efforts of the whole team."

Paes was recognised as a prodigy by Vijay Amritraj in the '80s. Even so, Paes' true mentor has been Naresh Kumar, the former Indian Davis Cup Captain. His incredible Davis Cup record speaks for itself. While it may be said that some of his Davis Cup victories were achieved because he was playing on his favourite surface, grass and enjoyed home support. But at Atlanta, Paes had none of these advantages except his coach, close family members and the expatriates. While Davis Cup victories bring in good cash rewards and ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) points, there he was playing for just a medal. Paes explains it all when he says, "When I am playing for my country I don't expect anything." That straightaway sets him apart.

He succeeds because of his willingness to take his chances, swift reflexes and mental strength, and the fact that he does not accept defeat easily.

#### **Vocabulary**

![](_page_5_Figure_7.jpeg)

- 4. An idiomatic expression is a group of words with a special meaning. The individual words in the expression do not mean what they otherwise stand for.
**Example:** Maria Sharapova cannot be 'pigeon-holed' or categorised. Her talent, unwavering desire to succeed and readiness to sacrifice have lifted her to the top of the world.

Here pigeon-holed does not mean that there is a hole for the pigeon to its nest. But it means that someone or something belongs to a particular type or group; is categorised, especially without knowing much about them.

Now, consult a dictionary and match the following idiomatic expressions given in Column 'A' with their meanings in Column 'B'.

### **Grammar**

In the chapter 'Reach for the Top' in *Beehive*, you have read that two clauses in a sentence have their own subject and verb or verb phrase. One part of the sentence (or one clause) tells us why or when something happened. **Examples:** 

- â€¢ I read Sherlock Holmes while I was on holiday.
- â€¢ It was raining heavily when I got home in the evening.
- â€¢ I will phone you when I go to the clinic.
- â€¢ Can I borrow your book when you have finished it?

#### 1. Match each of the sentence halves given below to make meaningful sentences.

Your teacher or a classmate will read the excerpt given below. Listen to it carefully and answer the questions.

Harvard-MIT researcher, Hugh Herr, is familiar with the obstacles faced by amputees. A world-class mountain climber at the age of 17, Herr and a friend were trapped in a snowstorm while ascending New Hampshire's Mount Washington in 1982. After three days without food or camping gear, the two were rescued, but frostbite cost Herr both his legs, which were amputated just below the knee. Herr was fitted with prostheses, but he soon discovered that they were developed for walking on flat surfaces, and not for taking on advanced functions like climbing or running. With the same determination that he once applied to climbing, he set out to create a better prosthetic leg. He worked with an engineering shop to fashion his own prostheses, tinkering with customised sockets and lighter materials. He even designed artificial feet specially made for climbing rock (built flat and narrow for getting a toehold in cracks and ice featuring sharp spikes).

"I experienced a tremendous amount of pain from prosthetic limbs at first", Herr says. "So I decided to go back to school and learn about physics and engineering to try to solve these problems." Herr obtained a Master's degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1993 and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard five years later.

After struggling for a decade to come up with a better prosthetic limb, just getting the knee to market will be a personal triumph for Herr â€” yet another mountain conquered. "It's been a long road", he says. "But I think I'm finally in a position to make a difference."
