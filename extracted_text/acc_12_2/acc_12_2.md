P artnership is an agreement between two or more persons (called partners) for sharing the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. Any change in the existing agreement amounts to reconstitution of the partnership firm. This results in an end of the existing agreement and a new agreement comes into being with a changed relationship among the members of the partnership firm and/or their composition. However, the firm continues. The partners often resort to reconstitution of the firm in various ways such as admission of a new partner, change in profit sharing ratio, retirement of a partner, death or insolvence of a partner. In this chapter we shall have a brief idea about all these and in detail about the accounting implications of admission of a new partner or an on change in the profit sharing ratio.

## 2.1 Modes of Reconstitution of a Partnership Firm

*Reconstitution of a partnership firm usually takes place in any of the following ways:*

*Admission of a new partner:* A new partner may be admitted when the firm needs additional capital or managerial help. According to the provisions of Partnership Act 1932 unless it is otherwise provided in the partnership deed a new partner can be admitted only when the existing partners unanimously agree for it. For example, Hari and Haqque are partners sharing profits in the ratio of

3:2. On April 1, 2017 they admitted John as a new partner with 1/6 share in profits of the firm. With this change now there are three partners of the firm and it stands reconstituted.

*Change in the profit sharing ratio among the existing partners:* Sometimes the partners of a firm may decide to change their existing profit sharing ratio. This may happen an account of a change in the existing partners' role in the firm. For example, Ram, Mohan and Sohan are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2:1. With effect from April 1,2017 they decided to share profits equally as Sohan brings in additional capital. This results in a change in the existing agreement leading to reconstitution of the firm.

*Retirement of an existing partner:* It means withdrawal by a partner from the business of the firm which may be due to his bad health, old age or change in business interests. In fact a partner can retire any time if the partnership is at will. For example, Roy, Ravi and Rao are partners in the firm sharing profits in the ratio of 2:2:1. On account of illness, Ravi retired from the firm on March 31, 2017. This results in reconstitution of the firm now having only two partners.

*Death of a partner:* Partnership may also stand reconstituted on death of a partner, if the remaining partners decide to continue the business of the firm as usual. For example, X,Y and Z are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio 3:2:1. X died on March 31, 2017. Y and Z decide to carry on the business sharing future profits equally. The continuity of business by Y and Z sharing future profits equally leads to reconstitution of the firm.

## 2.2 Admission of a New Partner

When firm requires additional capital or managerial help or both for the expansion of its business a new partner may be admitted to supplement its existing resources. According to the Partnership Act 1932, a new partner can be admitted into the firm only with the consent of all the existing partners unless otherwise agreed upon. With the admission of a new partner, the partnership firm is reconstituted and a new agreement is entered into to carry on the business of the firm.

A newly admitted partner acquires two main rights in the firm–

- 1. Right to share the assets of the partnership firm; and
- 2. Right to share the profits of the partnership firm.

For the right to acquire share in the assets and profits of the partnership firm, the partner brings an agreed amount of capital either in cash or in kind. Moreover, in the case of an established firm which may be earning more profits than the normal rate of return on its capital the new partner is required to contribute some additional amount known as premium or goodwill. This is done primarily to compensate the sacrificing partners for loss of their share in super profits of the firm.

Following are the other important points which require attention at the time of admission of a new partner:

- 1. New profit sharing ratio;
- 2. Sacrificing ratio;
- 3. Valuation and adjustment of goodwill;
- 4. Revaluation of assets and Reassessment of liabilities;
- 5. Distribution of accumulated profits (reserves); and
- 6. Adjustment of partners' capitals.

## 2.3 New Profit Sharing Ratio

When new partner is admitted he acquires his share in profits from the old partners. In other words, on the admission of a new partner, the old partners sacrifice a share of their profit in favour of the new partner. But, what will be the share of new partner and how he will acquire it from the existing partners is decided mutually among the old partners and the new partner. However, if nothing is specified as to how does the new partner acquire his share from the old partners; it may be assumed that he gets it from them in their profit sharing ratio. In any case, on admission of a new partner, the profit sharing ratio among the old partners will change keeping in view their respective contribution to the profit sharing ratio of the incoming partner. Hence, there is a need to ascertain the new profit sharing ratio among all the partners. This depends upon how does the new partner acquires his share from the old partners for which there are many possibilities. Let us understand it with the help of the following illustrations.

## *Illustration 1*

Anil and Vishal are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admitted Sumit as a new partner for 1/5 share in the future profits of the firm. Calculate new profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit.

## *Solution*

| Sumit's share | = | 1 |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 5 |  |  |  |
| Remaining share | = | 1  1 |  | = | 4 |
|  |  | 5 |  |  | 5 |
| Anil's new share | = | 3 of | 4 | = | 12 |
|  |  | 5 | 5 |  | 25 |
| Vishal's new share | = | 2 of | 4 | = | 8 |
|  |  | 5 | 5 |  | 25 |

New profit sharing ratio of Anil, Vishal and Sumit will be 12:8:5.

*Note:* It has been assumed that the new partner acquired his share from old partners in old ratio.

## *Illustration 2*

Akshay and Bharati are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admit Dinesh as a new partner for 1/5th share in the future profits of the firm which he gets equally from Akshay and Bharati. Calculate new profit sharing ratio of Akshay, Bharati and Dinesh.

## *Solution*

| Dinesh's share | = | 1 | or | 2 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 5 |  | 10 |  |
| Akshay's share | = | 3 | 1  |  | 5 |
|  |  | 5 | 10 |  | 10 |
| Bharati's share | = | 2 | 1  |  | 3 |
|  |  | 5 | 10 |  | 10 |

New profit sharing ratio between Akshay, Bharati and Dinesh will be 5:3:2.

## *Illustration 3*

Anshu and Nitu are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admitted Jyoti as a new partner for 3/10 share which she acquired 2/10 from Anshu and 1/10 from Nitu. Calculate the new profit sharing ratio of Anshu, Nitu and Jyoti.

## *Solution*

| Jyoti's share | = | 3 |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 10 |  |  |
| Anshu's new share | = | 3  | 2 | 4  |
|  |  | 5 | 10 | 10 |
| Nitu's new share | = |  |  | Old share – Share Surrendered |
|  | = | 2  | 1 | 3  |
|  |  | 5 | 10 | 10 |
| The new profit sharing ratio between |  |  |  |  |

Anshu, Nitu and Jyoti will be 4 : 3 : 3.

## *Illustration 4*

Ram and Shyam are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admit Ghanshyam as a new partner. Ram sacrificed 1/4 of his share and Shyam 1/3 of his share in favour of Ghanshyam. Calculate new profit sharing ratio of Ram, Shyam and Ghanshyam.

#### *Solution*

| Ram's old share | = | 3 |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 5 |  |  |  |
| Share sacrificed by Ram | = | 1 | of 3 |  | 3 |
|  |  | 4 | 5 |  | 20 |
| Ram's new share | = | 3  | 3  | 9 |  |
|  |  | 5 | 20 | 20 |  |
| Shyam's old share | = | 2 |  |  |  |
|  |  | 5 |  |  |  |

|  |  | 3 | 5 | 15 |  |
| Shyam's new share | = | 2  | 2  | 4 |  |
|  |  | 5 | 15 | 15 |  |
| Ghanshyam's new share | = |  |  |  | Ram's sacrifice + Shyam's Sacrifice |
|  | = | 3  | 2 | 17  |  |
|  |  | 20 | 15 | 60 |  |

New profit sharing ratio among Ram, Shyam and Ghanshyam will be 27:16:17.

#### *Illustration 5*

Das and Sinha are partners in a firm sharing profits in 4:1 ratio. They admitted Pal as a new partner for 1/4 share in the profits, which he acquired wholly from Das. Determine the new profit sharing ratio of the partners.

#### *Solution*

| Pal's share | = | 1 4 |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Das's new share | = |  |  |  | Old Share – Share Surrendered |
|  | = | 4 | 1  | = | 11 |
|  |  | 5 | 4 |  | 20 |
|  |  | 1 |  |  |  |
| Sinha's new share | = |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | 5 |  |  |  |

The new profit sharing ratio among Das, Sinha and Pal will be 11:4:5.

#### 2.4 Sacrificing Ratio

The ratio in which the old partners agree to sacrifice their share of profit in favour of the incoming partner is called sacrificing ratio. The sacrifice by a partner is equal to :

Old Share of Profit – New Share of Profit

As stated earlier, the new partner is required to compensate the old partner's for their loss of share in the super profits of the firm for which he brings in an additional amount as premium for goodwill. This amount is shared by the existing partners in the ratio in which they forgo their shares in favour of the new partner which is called sacrificing ratio.

The ratio is normally clearly given as agreed among the partners which could be the old ratio, equal sacrifice, or a specified ratio. The difficulty arises where the ratio in which the new partner acquires his share from the old partners is not specified. Instead, the new profit sharing ratio is given. In such a situation, the sacrificing ratio is to be worked out by deducting each partner's new share from his old share. Look at the illustrations 6 to 8 and see how sacrificing ratio is calculated in such a situation.

#### *Illustration 6*

Rohit and Mohit are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 5:3. They admit Bijoy as a new partner for 1/7 share in the profit. The new profit sharing ratio will be 4:2:1. Calculate the sacrificing ratio of Rohit and Mohit.

#### *Solution*

![](_page_5_Figure_6.jpeg)

Sacrificing ratio among Rohit and Mohit will be 3:5.

#### *Illustration 7*

Amar and Bahadur are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 3:2. They admitted Mary as a new partner for 1/4 share. The new profit sharing ratio between Amar and Bahadur will be 2:1. Calculate their sacrificing ratio.

#### *Solution*

| 1 | Mary's share = |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1 3 = 1 | Remaining share = |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| This 3/4 share is to be shared by Amar and Bahadur in the ratio of 2:1. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Therefore, |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 of 3 = | Amar's new share = |  |  |  | 6 or | 2 |
| 3 4 |  |  |  |  | 12 | 4 |
| of 3 | Bahadur's new share = | 1 |  |  | 3 | 1 |
| = 4 |  | 3 |  |  | 12 or | 4 |
| New profit sharing ratio of Amar, Bahadur and Mary will be 2:1:1. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 2   | Amar's sacrifice = |  | 2 |  |  |  |
| 5 20 |  |  | 4 |  |  |  |
| 2 1 3   | Bahadur's sacrifice = |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  | 4 | 20 |  |  |

Sacrificing ratio among Amar and Bahadur will be 2:3.

#### *Illustration 8*

Ramesh and Suresh are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 4:3. They admitted Mohan as a new partner. The profit sharing ratio of Ramesh, Suresh and Mohan will be 2:3:1. Calculate the gain or sacrifice of old partner.

#### *Solution*

| Ramesh's old share | = | 4 |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 7 |  |  |  |
| Ramesh's new share | = | 2 |  |  |  |
|  |  | 6 |  |  |  |
| Ramesh's sacrifice | = | 4 | 2  |  | 10 |
|  |  | 7 | 6 |  | 42 |
| Suresh's new share | = | 3 |  |  |  |
|  |  | 6 |  |  |  |
| Suresh's old share | = | 3 |  |  |  |
|  |  | 7 |  |  |  |
| Suresh's gain | = | 3 | 3  |  | 3 |
|  |  | 6 | 7 |  | 42 |
| Mohan's share | = | 1 | or | 7 |  |
|  |  | 6 |  | 42 |  |

Ramesh's sacrifice = Suresh's gain+Mohan's gain

$$\begin{array}{r l}{={}}&{{}{\frac{3}{42}}+{\frac{7}{42}}={\frac{10}{42}}}\end{array}$$

In this case, the whole sacrifice is by Ramesh alone.

#### Test your Understanding - I 1. A and B are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 3:1. They admit C for 1/4 share in the future profits. The new profit sharing ratio will be: (a) A 9 16 , B 3 16 , C 4 16 (b) A 8 16 , B 4 16 , C 4 16 (c) A 10 16 , B 2 16 , C 4 16 (d) A 8 16 , B 9 16 , C 10 16 2. X and Y share profits in the ratio of 3:2. Z was admitted as a partner who sets 1/5 share. New profit sharing ratio, if Z acquires 3/20 from X and 1/20 from Y would be: (a) 9 : 7 : 4 (b) 8 : 8 : 4 (c) 6 : 10 : 4 (d) 10 : 6 : 4 3. A and B share profits and losses in the ratio of 3 : 1, C is admitted into partnership for 1/4 share. The sacrificing ratio of A and B is: (a) equal (b) 3 : 1 (c) 2 : 1 (d) 3 : 2.

## 2.5 Goodwill

Goodwill is also one of the special aspects of partnership accounts which requires adjustment (also valuation if not specified) at the time of reconstitution of a firm viz., a change in the profit sharing ratio, the admission of a partner or the retirement or death of a partner.

## *2.5.1 Meaning of Goodwill*

Over a period of time, a well-established business develops an advantage of good name, reputation and wide business connections. This helps the business to earn more profits as compared to a newly set up business. In accounting, the monetary value of such advantage is known as "goodwill".

It is as an intangible asset. In other words, goodwill is the value of the reputation of a firm in respect of the profits expected in future over and above the normal profits. It is generally observed that when a person pays for goodwill, he/she pays for something, which places him in the position of being able to earn super profits as compared to the profit earned by other firms in the same industry.

In simple words, goodwill can be defined as "the present value of a firm's anticipated excess earnings" or as "the capitalised value attached to the differential profit capacity of a business". Thus, goodwill exists only when the firm earns super profits. Any firm that earns normal profits or is incurring losses has no goodwill.

## *2.5.2 Factors Affecting the Value of Goodwill*

The main factors affecting the value of goodwill are as follows:

- 1. *Nature of business:* A firm that produces high value added products or having a stable demand is able to earn more profits and therefore has more goodwill.
- 2. *Location:* If the business is centrally located or is at a place having heavy customer traffic, the goodwill tends to be high.
- 3. *Efficiency of management:* A well-managed concern usually enjoys the advantage of high productivity and cost efficiency. This leads to higher profits and so the value of goodwill will also be high.
- 4. *Market situation:* The monopoly condition or limited competition enables the concern to earn high profits which leads to higher value of goodwill.
- 5. *Special advantages:* The firm that enjoys special advantages like import licences, low rate and assured supply of electricity, long-term contracts for supply of materials, well-known collaborators, patents, trademarks, etc. enjoy higher value of goodwill.

## *2.5.3 Need for Valuation of Goodwill*

Normally, the need for valuation of goodwill arises at the time of sale of a business. But, in the context of a partnership firm it may also arise in the following circumstances:

- 1. Change in the profit sharing ratio amongst the existing partners;
- 2. Admission of new partner;
- 3. Retirement of a partner;
- 4. Death of a partner; and
- 5. Dissolution of a firm involving sale of business as a going concern.
- 6. Amalgamation of partnership firms.

## *2.5.4 Methods of Valuation of Goodwill*

Since goodwill is an intangible asset it is very difficult to accurately calculate its value. Various methods have been advocated for the valuation of goodwill of a partnership firm. Goodwill calculated by one method may differ from the goodwill

calculated by another method. Hence, the method by which goodwill is to be calculated, may be specifically decided between the existing partners and the incoming partner.

The important methods of valuation of goodwill are as follows:

- 1. Average Profits Method
- 2. Super Profits Method
- 3. Capitalisation Method

## *2.5.4.1 Average Profits Method*

Under this method, the goodwill is valued at agreed number of 'years' purchase of the average profits of the past few years. It is based on the assumption that a new business will not be able to earn any profits during the first few years of its operations. Hence, the person who purchases a running business must pay in the form of goodwill a sum which is equal to the profits he is likely to receive for the first few years. The goodwill, therefore, should be calculated by multiplying the past average profits by the number of years during which the anticipated profits are expected to accrue.

For example, if the past average profits of a business works out at Rs. 20,000 and it is expected that such profits are likely to continue for another three years, the value of goodwill will be Rs. 60,000 (Rs. 20,000 3),

## *Illustration 9*

The profit for the five years of a firm are as follows – year 2013 Rs. 4,00,000; year 2014 Rs. 3,98,000; year 2015 Rs. 4,50,000; year 2016 Rs. 4,45,000 and year 2017 Rs. 5,00,000. Calculate goodwill of the firm on the basis of 4 years purchase of 5 years average profits.

|  | Year | Profit |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | (Rs.) |
|  | 2013 | 4,00,000 |
|  | 2014 | 3,98,000 |
|  | 2015 | 4,50,000 |
|  | 2016 | 4,45,000 |
|  | 2017 | 5,00,000 |
|  | Total | 21,93,000 |
| Average Profit | TotalProfit of Last 5 Years = | = Rs. 21,93,000 = Rs. 4,38,600 |
|  | No.of years | 5 |
| Goodwill | = Average Profits × No. of years purchased |  |
|  | = Rs. 4,38,600 × 4 = Rs. 17,54,400 |  |

## *Solution*

The above calculation of goodwill is based on the assumption that no change in the overall situation of profits is expected in the future.

The above illustration is based on simple average. Sometimes, if there exists an increasing on decreasing trend, it is considered to be better to give a higher weightage to the profits to the recent years than those of the earlier years. Hence, it is a advisable to work out weighted average based on specified weights like 1, 2, 3, 4 for respective year's profit. However, weighted average should be used only if specified. (See illustrations 10 and 11).

#### *Illustration 10*

The profits of firm for the five years are as follows:

| Year | Profit |
| --- | --- |
|  | (Rs.) |
| 2012–13 | 20,000 |
| 2013–14 | 24,000 |
| 2014–15 | 30,000 |
| 2015–16 | 25,000 |
| 2016–17 | 18,000 |

Calculate the value of goodwill on the basis of three years' purchase of weighted average profits based on weights 1,2,3,4 and 5 respectively.

#### *Solution*

| Year Ended 31st March | Profit | Weight | Product |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (Rs.) |  |  |
| 2012–13 | 20,000 | 1 | 20,000 |
| 2013–14 | 24,000 | 2 | 48,000 |
| 2014–15 | 30,000 | 3 | 90,000 |
| 2015–16 | 25,000 | 4 | 1,00,000 |
| 2016–17 | 18,000 | 5 | 90,000 |
|  |  | 15 | 3,48,000 |

| Weighted Average Profit = Rs. 3,48,000 | = Rs. 23,200 |
| --- | --- |
| 15 |  |
| Goodwill | = Rs. 23,200 × 3 = Rs. 69,600 |

## *Illustration 11*

Calculate goodwill of a firm on the basis of three year' purchase of the weighted average profits of the last four years. The profit of the last four years were: 2012 Rs. 20,200; 2013 Rs. 24,800; 2014 Rs. 20,000 and 2015 Rs. 30,000. The weights assigned to each year are : 2012 – 1; 2013 – 2; 2014 – 3 and 2015 – 4. You are supplied the following information:

- 1. On September 1, 2014 a major plant repair was undertaken for Rs. 6,000, which was charged to revenue. The said sum is to be capitalised for goodwill calculation subject to adjustment of depreciation of 10% p.a. on reducing balance method.
- 2. The Closing Stock for the year 2013 was overvalued by Rs. 2,400.
- 3. To cover management cost an annual charge of Rs. 4,800 should be made for purpose of goodwill valuation.

| Adjusted Profits | 15,400 | 17,600 | 23,400 | 24,620 |

## *Solution*

Calculation of weighted average profits:

|  |  |  | (Rs.) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year | Profit | Weight | Product |
| 2012 | 15,400 | 1 | 15,400 |
| 2013 | 17,600 | 2 | 35,200 |
| 2014 | 23,400 | 3 | 70,200 |
| 2015 | 24,620 | 4 | 98,480 |
| Total |  | 10 | 2,19,280 |

Weight Average Profit = Rs. 2,19,280 10 = Rs. 21,928

Goodwill = Rs. 21,928 × 3 = Rs. 65,784

*Notes to Solution*

| (i) | Depreciation of 2014 | = 10% of Rs. 6000 for 4 months |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | = Rs. 6000  10/100  4/12 = Rs. 200 |
| (ii) | Depreciation of 2015 | = 10% of Rs. 6000 – Rs. 200 for one year |
|  |  | = Rs. 5800  10/100 + Rs. 580 |

(iii) Closing Stock of 2014 will become opening stock for the year 2015.

#### *2.5.4.2 Super Profits Method*

The basic assumption in the average profits (simple or weighted) method of calculating goodwill is that if a new business is set up, it will not be able to earn any profits during the first few years of its operations. Hence, the person who purchases an existing business has to pay in the form of goodwill a sum equal to the total profits he is likely to receive for the first 'few years'. But it is contended that the buyer's real benefit does not lie in total profits; it is limited to such amounts of profits which are in excess of the normal return on capital employed in similar business. Therefore, it is desirable to value, goodwill on the basis of the excess profits and not the actual profits. The excess of actual profits over the normal profits is termed as super profits.

> Normal Profit = Firm's Capital × Normal Rate of Return 100

Firms capital includes partners capital and reserves and surplus but excludes fictitious assets and goodwill.

Suppose an existing firm earns Rs. 18,000 on the capital of Rs. 1,50,000 and the normal rate of return is 10%. The Normal profits will work out at Rs. 15,000 (1,50,000 × 10/100). The super profits in this case will be Rs. 3,000 (Rs. 18,000 – 15,000). The goodwill under the super profit method is ascertained by multiplying the super profits by certain number of years' purchase. If, in the above example, it is expected that the benefit of super profits is likely to be available for 5 years in future, the goodwill will be valued at Rs. 15,000 (3,000 × 5). Thus, the steps involved under the method are:

- 1. Calculate the average profit,
- 2. Calculate the normal profit on the firm's capital on the basis of the normal rate of return,
- 3. Calculate the super profits by deducting normal profit from the average profits, and
- 4. Calculate goodwill by multiplying the super profits by the given number of years' purchase.

## *Illustration 12*

The books of a business showed that the firm's capital employed on December 31, 2015, Rs. 5,00,000 and the profits for the last five years were: 2011–Rs. 40,000: 2012-Rs. 50,000; 2013-Rs. 55,000; 2014- Rs.70,000 and 2015-Rs. 85,000. You are required to find out the value of goodwill based on 3 years purchase of the super profits of the business, given that the normal rate of return is 10%.

## *Solution*

  
Normal Profits = $\frac{\mbox{Firm's Capital}\times\mbox{Normal Rate of Return}}{100}$  
  
= Rs. $\frac{5,00,000\times10}{100}$ = Rs. 50,000

*Average Profits:*

| Year | Profit |
| --- | --- |
|  | (Rs.) |
| 2011 | 40,000 |
| 2012 | 50,000 |
| 2013 | 55,000 |
| 2014 | 70,000 |
| 2015 | 85,000 |
| Total | 3,00,000 |

Average Profits = Rs. 3,00,000/5 = Rs. 60,000 Super Profit = Rs. 60,000 – Rs. 50,000 = Rs. 10,000 Goodwill = Rs. 10,000 3 = Rs. 30,000

## *Illustration 13*

The capital of the firm of Anu and Benu is Rs. 1,00,000 and the market rate of interest is 15%. Annual salary to partners is Rs. 6,000 each. The profits for the last 3 years were Rs. 30,000; Rs. 36,000 and Rs. 42,000. Goodwill is to be valued at 2 years purchase of the last 3 years' average super profits. Calculate the goodwill of the firm.

### *Solution*

|  |  |  | 100 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interest on capital Add: partner's salary | = = | 1,00,000  Rs. 6,000  | 15 2 | = Rs. 15,000…………(i) = Rs. 12,000…………(ii) |

| Normal Profit(i+ii) | = Rs. 27,000 |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Average Profit | = | Rs. 30,000+Rs.36,000+Rs.42,000 = Rs.1,08,000 |
|  |  | 3 |
|  | = | Rs. 36,000 |
| Super Profit | = | Average Profit–Normal Profit |
|  | = | Rs. 36,000–Rs. 27,000 |
|  | = | Rs. 9,000 |
| Goodwill | = | Super Profit × No of years' purchase |
|  | = | Rs. 9,000 × 2 |
|  | = | Rs. 18,000 |

## *2.5.4.3 Capitalisation Method*

Under this method the goodwill can be calculated in two ways: (a) by capitalizing the average profits, or (b) by capitalising the super profits.

- (a) *Capitalisation of Average Profits:* Under this method, the value of goodwill is ascertained by deducting the actual firm's capital in the business from the capitalized value of the average profits on the basis of normal rate of return. This involves the following steps:
	- (i) Ascertain the average profits based on the past few years' performance.
	- (ii) Capitalize the average profits on the basis of the normal rate of return to ascertain the capitalised value of average profits as follows:

#### Average Profits × 100/Normal Rate of Return

- (iii) Ascertain the actual firm's capital (net assets) by deducting outside liabilities from the total assets (excluding goodwill and ficticious assets).
## Firms' Capital = Total Assets (excluding goodwill) – Outside Liabilities Where outside Liabilities include both long term and short term Liabilities.

- (iv) Compute the value of goodwill by deducting net assets from the capitalised value of average profits, i.e. (ii) – (iii).
## *Illustration 14*

A business has earned average profits of Rs. 1,00,000 during the last few years and the normal rate of return in a similar business is 10%. Ascertain the value of goodwill by capitalisation average profits method, given that the value of net assets of the business is Rs. 8,20,000.

#### *Solution*

Capitalised Value of Average Profits Rs. 1,00,000 100 10 = Rs. 10,00,000

- Goodwill = Capitalised value Net Assets
	- = Rs. 10,00,000 Rs. 8,20,000 = Rs.1,80,000
	- (b) *Capitalisation of Super Profits:* Goodwill can also be ascertained by capitalising the super profit directly. Under this method there is no need to work out the capitalised value of average profits. It involves the following steps.
	- (i) Calculate capital of the firm, which is equal to total assets (excluding goodwill and ficticious assets) *minus outside liabilities*.
	- (ii) Calculate normal profits on capital employed.
	- (iii) Calculate average profit for past years, as specified.
	- (ii) Calculate super profits by deducting normal profits from average profits.
	- (iii) Multiply the super profits by the required rate of return multiplier, that is,

#### Goodwill = Super Profits × 100 Normal Rate of Return

In other words, goodwill is the capitalised value of super profits. The amount of goodwill worked out by this method will be exactly the same as calculated by capitalising the average profits.

For example, using the data given in illustration 14 where the average profits are Rs. 1,00,000 and the normal profits are Rs. 82,000 (10% of Rs. 8,20,000), the super profits worked out as Rs. 18,000 (Rs. 1,00,000 – Rs. 82,000), the goodwill will be calculated as follows.

Rs. 18,000 x $\frac{100}{10}$ = Rs. 1,80,000.  

#### *Illustration 15*

- 1. The goodwill of a firm is to be worked out at three years' purchase of the average profits of the last five years which are as follows:

| Years | Profits (Loss) |
| --- | --- |
|  | (Rs.) |
| 2012 | 10,000 |
| 2013 | 15,000 |
| 2014 | 4,000 |
| 2015 | (5,000) |
| 2016 | 6,000 |

- 2. The capital of the firm is Rs. 1,00,000 and normal rate of return is 8%, the average profits for last 5 years are Rs. 12,000 and goodwill is to be worked out at 3 years' purchase of super profits,
- 3. Rama Brothers earn an average profit of Rs. 30,000 with a capital of Rs. 2,00,000. The normal rate of return in the business is 10%. Using capitalisation of super profits method work out the value the goodwill of the firm.

## *Solution*

1. Total Profits = Rs. 10,000 + Rs. 15,000 + Rs. 4,000 + Rs. 6,000 – Rs. 5,000 = Rs. 30,000 Average Profits = Rs. 30,000/5 = Rs. 6,000 Goodwill = Average Profits × 3 = Rs. 6,000 3 = Rs.18,000 2. Average Profit = Rs. 12,000 Normal Profit = Rs.1,00,000 8 100 = Rs. 8,000 Super Profit=Average Profit – Normal profit = Rs. 12,000 – Rs. 8,000 = Rs. 4,000 Goodwill=Super Profit 3 = Rs. 4,000 3 = Rs. 12,000 3. Normal Profit= Rs. 2,00,000 10/100 = Rs. 20,000 Super Profit = Average Profit – Normal Profit = Rs. 30,000 – Rs. 20,000 = Rs. 10,000 Goodwill=Super Profit 100/Normal Rate of Return = 10,000 100/10 = Rs. 1,00,000.

## *2.5.5 Treatment of Goodwill*

As stated earlier, the incoming partner who acquires his share in the profits of the firm from the existing partners brings in additional amount to compensate them for loss of their share in super profits. It is termed as his share of goodwill (also called premium for goodwill).

## *2.5.5.1 When the new Partner brings goodwill in cash.*

The amount of premium brought in by the new partner is shared by the existing partners in their ratio of sacrifice. If this amount is paid to the old partners directly (privately) by the new partner, no entry is passed in the books of the firm. But, when the amount is paid through the firm, which is generally the case, the following journal entries are passed:

| (i) | Bank A/c | Dr. |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | To Premium for Goodwill A/c |  |
|  | (Amount brought by new partner as premium) |  |
| (ii) | Goodwill A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Sacrificing Partners Capital A/c |  |
|  | (Individually)(Goodwill distributed among the |  |
|  | existing partners' in their sacrificing ratio). |  |

Alternatively, it is credited to the new partner's capital account and then adjusted in favour of the existing partners in their sacrificing ratio. In that case the journal entries will be as follows:

| (i) | Bank A/c | Dr. |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | To New Partner's Capital A/c |  |
|  | (Amount brought by new partner for his share |  |
|  | of goodwill). |  |
| (ii) | New Partner's Capital A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Sacrificing Partner's Capital A/c's |  |
|  | (Individually) |  |
|  | (Goodwill brought by new partners distributed |  |
|  | among the existing partners in their sacrificing |  |
|  | ratio) |  |

If the partners decide that the amount of premium for goodwill credited to their capital accounts should be retained in business, an additional entry is not passed. If, however, they decide to withdraw their amounts, (in full or in part) the following additional entry will be passed:

> Existing Partner's Capital A/c (Individually) Dr. To Bank A/c (The amount of goodwill withdrawn by the existing partners)

Vijay and Sanjay are partners in a firm sharing profits and losses in the ratio of 3:2. They admitted Ajay into partnership with 1/4 share in profits. Ajay brings in Rs. 30,000 for capital and the requisite amount of premium in cash. The goodwill of the firm is valued at Rs. 20,000. The new profit sharing ratio is 2:1:1. Vijay and Sanjay withdraw their share of goodwill. Give necessary journal entries.

## *Solution*

- (a) Ajay will bring Rs. 5,000 (1/4 of Rs. 20,000) as his share of goodwill (premium)
- (b) Sacrificing Ratio is 2:3 as calculated below:

For Vijay, old ratio is 3/5 and the new ratio is 2/4, hence, his sacrificing ratio is

$$={\frac{1}{5}}-{\frac{2}{4}}\,=\,{\frac{12\,\cdot\,10}{20}}\,=\,{\frac{2}{20}}$$

For Sanjay, old ratio is 2/5 and the new ratio is 1/4, hence, his sacrificing

*When goodwill already exists in books:* Goodwill, if existing in the books of the firm, it is written off at the time of admission of a partner.

For example, in Illustration 17, the goodwill of the firm is valued at Rs. 20,000 and Ajay who is admitted to 1/4 share in its profits, brings in Rs. 5,000 as his share of goodwill. Suppose, goodwill already appeared in books at Rs. 10,000 the following additional journal entry shall be passed for writing off the existing amount of goodwill.

## When the new partner does not bring goodwill in cash, partly or fully

Goodwill not brought by the new partner will be debited to current account of new partner while sacrificing partners' capital accounts will be credited for their respective shares.

When the new partner does not bring the share of goodwill, there exists two possibilities :

- (a) Goodwill does not exist in the books; and.
- (b) Goodwill exists in the books.

#### *Goodwill does not exist in the books*

When goodwill does not exist in the books, sacrificing partners are credited with their share of goodwill and new partner is debited by the amount of goodwill not brought by him. The journal entry in this case is : Incoming (New) Partners Current A/c Dr.

To Sacrificing Partners Capital A/c (individually) (Account of goodwill not brought in by new partner)

Sometimes the new partner brings part of premium for goodwill in cash. In such a situation, new partners current account will be debited by the amount not brought by new partner.

For example, for the share of goodwill of Rs. 50,000 the new partner brings Rs. 20,000 only. In this situation the journal entry will be :

| (i) | Bank A/c | Dr. | 20,000 | 20,000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | To Premium for Goodwill A/c |  |  |  |

#### Applicability of Accounting Standard 26: Intangible Assets

The Standard comes into effect in respect of expenditure incurred on intangible items during the accounting periods commencing on or after April 1, 2003. As per the Standard, Intangible Asset under AS 26 is defined as an identifiable, non monetary, without physical existence and held for use in the production or supply of goods or services for rental to others or for administrative purposes.

Significant requirements of AS 26 w.r.t Intangible Assets:

- 1. Intangible asset should be recognised by fulfilling the criteria as recognised under AS 26.
- 2. If an in asset does not satisfy recognition criteria, it should be expensed.
- 3. Internally generated goodwill should not be recognised as an asset.
- 4. Internally generated brands, mastheads, and publishing titles and other similar in substance should not be recognised as intangible assets.
- 5. Internally generated assets other than the goodwill, brands, mastheads, and publishing titles may be recognised provided they satisfy recognition criteria as prescribed by AS 26.
- 6. Intangible assets should be written off as early as possible but not exceeding its estimated life, which normally should not be beyond 10 years.

Accounting Standard 26 implies that:

- (a) Purchased goodwill may be accounted for in the books and shown as an asset, where it is accounted for in the books and shown as assets, it should be written off as early as possible, but where it is to be written- off in more than one accounting year, it should be written off in a period not exceeding 10 years. In line with what is prescribed by the Accounting Standard, goodwill appearing in the balance sheet in written off at the time of firm's reconstitution.
- (b) Self generated goodwill is not accounted for in the books and shown as an asset. Thus if self generated goodwill be debited to goodwill account it should be written - off in the same financial year and should not be shown as an asset in the balance sheet. Alternatively value of goodwill may be adjusted by deducting new partners' current account and crediting in their sacrificing ratio. The effect under both the methods is same.

	- (d) none of the above.
- 2. Asha and Nisha are partner's sharing profit in the ratio of 2:1. Asha's son Ashish was admitted for 1/4 share of which 1/8 was gifted by Asha to her son. The remaining was contributed by Nisha. Goodwill of the firm in valued at Rs. 40,000. How much of the goodwill will be credited to the old partner's capital account.

	- (a) old partners in old profit sharing ratio
	- (b) old partners in new profit sharing ratio
	- (c) all the partner in the new profit sharing ratio.

## *2.5.5.2 Hidden Goodwill*

Sometimes the value of goodwill is not given at the time of admission of a new partner. In such a situation it has to be inferred from the arrangement of the capital and profit sharing ratio. Suppose, A and B are partners sharing profits equally with capitals of Rs. 45,000 each. They admitted C as a new partner for one-third share in the profit. C brings in Rs. 60,000 as his capital. Based on the amount brought in by C and his share in profit, the total capital of the newly constituted firm works out to be Rs.1,80,000 (Rs. 60,000 × 3). But the actual total capital of A, B and C works out as Rs. 1,50,000 (Rs. 45,000 + Rs. 45,000 + Rs. 60,000). Hence, it can be inferred that the difference is on account of goodwill i.e., Rs. 30,000 (Rs. 1,80,000 – Rs. 1,50,000). Which is to be shared equally (old ratio) by A and B. This shall raise their capital accounts to Rs. 60,000 each and total capital of the firm to Rs. 1,80,000. In this, C's Current account will be debited by Rs. 10,000 (his share of goodwill) and A and B's Capital accounts credited by Rs. 5,000 each.

- 1. A firm's profits for the last three years are Rs. 5,00,000; Rs. 4,00,000 and Rs. 6,00,000. Calculate value of firm's goodwill on the basis of four years' purchase of the average profits for the last three years.
- 2. A firm's profits during 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were Rs. 16,000; Rs. 20,000; Rs. 24,000 and Rs. 32,000 respectively. The firm has capital investment of Rs. 1,00,000. A fair rate of return on investment is 18% p.a. Compute goodwill based on three years' purchase of the average super profits for the last four years.
- 3. Based on the data given in the above question, calculate goodwill by capitalisation of super profits method. Will the amount of goodwill be different if it is computed by capitalisation of average profits? Confirm your answer by numerical verification.
- 4. Giri and Shanta are partners in a firm sharing profits equally. They admit Kachroo into partnership who, in addition to capital, brings Rs. 20,000 as goodwill for 1/5th share of profits in the firm. What shall be journal entries if:
	- (a) no goodwill appears in the books of the firm.
	- (b) goodwill appears in the books of the firm at Rs. 40,000.

#### 2.6 Adjustment for Accumulated Profits and Losses

Sometimes a firm may have accumulated profits not yet transferred to capital accounts of the partners. These are usually in the form of general reserve, reserve and/or Profit and Loss Account. The new partner is not entitled to have any share in such accumulated profits. These are distributed among the partners by transferring it to their capital current accounts in old profit sharing ratio. Similarly, if there are some accumulated losses in the form of a debit balance of profit and loss account and/or deferred revenue expenditure appearing in the balance sheet of the firm.

It should be transferred to the old partners' capital accounts (see Illustration 22).

## *Illustration 22*

Rajinder and Surinder are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratio of 4:1. On April 15, 2017 they admit Narender as a new partner. On that date there was a balance of Rs. 20,000 in general reserve and a debit balance of Rs. 10,000 in the profit and loss account of the firm. Pass necessary journal entries regarding adjustment of a accumulate a profit or loss.

## 2.7 Revaluation of Assets and Reassessment of Liabilities

At the time of admission of a new partner, it is always desirable to ascertain whether the assets of the firm are shown in books at their current values. In case the assets are overstated or understated, these are revalued. Similarly, a reassessment of the liabilities is also done so that these are brought in the books at their correct values. At times there may also be some unrecorded assets and liabilities of the firm. These also have to be brought into the books of the firm. For this purpose the firm has to prepare the Revaluation Account. The gain or loss on revaluation of each asset and liability is transferred to this account and finally its balance is transferred to the capital accounts of the old partners in their old profit sharing ratio. In other words, the revaluation account is credited with increase in the value of each asset and decrease in its liabilities because it is a gain and is debited with decrease in the value of assets and increase in its liabilities is debited to revaluation account because it is a loss. Similarly unrecorded assets are credited and unrecorded liabilities are debited to the revaluation account. If the revaluation account finally shows a credit balance then it indicates net gain and if there is a debit balance then it indicates net loss. Which will be transferred to the capital accounts of the old partners in old ratio.

The journal entries recorded for revaluation of assets and reassessment of liabilities are as follows:

The Capitals of Ashoo and Rahul, after all adjustments relating to revaluation, goodwill etc., worked out to be Rs. 45,000 and Rs. 35,000 respectively.

Required: Calculate New Profit sharing ratio, capital to be brought in by Gaurav and record necessary journal entries for the same.

## 2.8 Adjustment of Capitals

Sometimes, at the time of admission, the partners agree that their capitals should also be adjusted so as to be proportionate to their profit sharing ratio. In such a situation, if the capital of the new partner is given, the same can be used as a base for calculating the new capitals of the old partners. The capitals thus ascertained should be compared with their old capitals after all adjustments relating to goodwill reserves and revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc. have been made; and then the partner whose capital falls short, will bring in the necessary amount to cover the shortage and the partner who has a surplus, will withdraw the excess amount of capital. (See Illustration 25)

## *Illustration 25*

A and B are partners sharing profits in the ratio of 2:1. C is admitted into the firm for 1/4 share of profits. C brings in Rs. 20,000 in respect of his capital. The capitals of old partners A and B, after all adjustments relating to goodwill, revaluation of assets and liabilities, etc., are Rs. 45,000 and Rs. 15,000 respectively. It is agreed that partners' capitals should be according to the new profit sharing ratio.

Determine the new capitals of A and B and record the necessary journal entries assuming that the partner whose capital falls short, brings in the amount of deficiency and the partner who has an excess, withdraws the excess amount.

#### *Solution*

1. Calculation of new profit sharing ratio: Assuming the new partner C quires his share from A and B in their old profit sharing ratio, i.e 2:1.

| Total Share = 1 |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C's Share = | 1 4 |  |  |
| Remaining Shares | = 1 | 1 − = | 3 |
|  |  | 4 | 4 |
| A's New Share | 3 = | 2 × | 6 = |
|  | 4 | 3 | 12 |
| B's New Share | 3 = | 1 × | 3 = |
|  | 4 | 3 | 12 |
| C's New Share | 1 = | 3 × | 3 = |
|  | 4 | 3 | 12 |

Thus, new profit sharing ratio between A,B and C is 6:3:3 or 2:1:1.

2. Required Capital of A and B

C's capital (who has 1/4 share in profits) is Rs. 20,000. B's new share in profits 1/4. Hence his capital will also be Rs. 20,000. A's new share is 2/4 which is double of C's share. Hence his capital will be Rs. 40,000.

Alternatively, based on C's capital, the total capital of the firm works out at Rs. 80,000 (4/1 × Rs.20,000). Hence, based on their share in profits, the capital of A and B will be:

| A's capital | = | 2 of 80,000 = Rs. 40,000 |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 4 |
| B's capital | = | 1 of 80,000 = Rs. 20,000 4 |

The capital of A and B after all adjustments have been made, are Rs. 45,000 and Rs. 15,000 respectively. Hence, A will withdraw Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 45,000– Rs.40,000) from the firm whereas B will contribute additional amount of Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 20,000–Rs.15,000). The journal entries will be :

| Date | Particulars | L.F. | Debit | Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | Amount | Amount |
|  |  |  | (Rs.) | (Rs.) |
|  | A's Capital A/c | Dr. | 5,000 |  |
|  | To Cash A/c |  |  | 5,000 |
|  | (Excess capital withdrawn by A) |  |  |  |

| Cash A/c | Dr. | 5,000 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| To B's Capital A/c |  |  | 5,000 |
| (Deficiency made good by additional |  |  |  |
| amount brought in by B) |  |  |  |

Sometimes, the total capital of the firm may clearly be specified and it is agreed that the capital of each partner should be proportionate to his share in profits. In such a situation each partner's capital (including the new partner's capital to be brought by him) is calculated on the basis of his share in profits. By bringing in additional amount or withdrawal of excess amount, the final capital of each partner can be brought up to the required level.

It may be noted that subject to agreement among the partners, surplus or deficiency in each old partners' capital accounts can also be taken care of simply by transfer to their respective current accounts. (See Illustration 26)

#### *Illustration 26*

A, B and C are partners in a firm sharing profits the ratio of 3:2:1. D is admitted into the firm for 1/4 share in profits, which he gets as 1/8 from A and 1/8 from B. The total capital of the firm is agreed upon as Rs. 1,20,000 and D is to bring in cash equivalent to 1/4 of this amount as his capital. The capitals of other partners are also to be adjusted in the ratio of their respective shares in profits. The capitals of A, B and C after all adjustments are Rs. 40,000, Rs. 35,000 and Rs. 30,000 respectively. Calculate the new capitals of A,B and C, and record the necessary journal entries.

#### *Solution*

- 1. Calculation of new profit sharing ratio:
A = 1 1 3 2 8 8 B = 1 1 5 3 8 24 

C will continue to get 1/6 as his share in the profits. Thus, the new profit sharing ratio between A,B,C and D will be:

$\begin{array}{c}\includegraphics[height=36.135pt]{24.eps}\end{array}$

- 2. Required capitals of all partners:
A's Capital = Rs. 1,20,000 9 24 = Rs. 45,000 B's Capital = Rs. 1,20,000 5 24 = Rs. 25,000

C's Capital = Rs. 1,20,000 4 24 = Rs. 20,000 D's Capital = Rs. 1,20,000 6 24 = Rs. 30,000

Hence, A will bring in Rs. 5,000 (Rs. 45,000 – Rs. 40,000), B will withdraw Rs. 10,000 (Rs. 35,000 – Rs. 25,000), C will withdraw Rs. 10,000 (Rs. 30,000 – Rs, 20,000) and D will bring in Rs. 30,000. Alternatively, the current accounts can be opened and the amounts to be brought in or withdrawn by A, B and C will be transferred to their respective current accounts subject to the agreement among the partners. The journal entries in this regard will be recorded as follows:

| Date | Particulars |  | L.F. | Debit | Credit |

#### *Notes*

1. New Profit Sharing Ratio

Since nothing is given as to how C acquired his share from A and B. It is assumed that A and B, between themselves continue to share the profit in the old ratio of 2:1.

  
C's Share of Profits = $\dfrac{1}{4}$  
  
Remaining Share  
  
A's New Share  
  
B's New Share  
  
B's New Share  
  
1 of $\dfrac{3}{4}=\dfrac{3}{12}=\dfrac{1}{4}$

Thus, new profit sharing ratio between A, B and C is 2:1:1.

2. New Capitals of A and B

C's capital is Rs 30,000 and his share of profits is 1/4. Based on C's capital, the total capital of the firm will work out at Rs 1,20,000 (4/1 × 30,000) and the respective capitals of A and B will be as follows :

  
A's Capital = 
$$\mathtt{=\,\,\frac{2}{4}\quad of\,1,20,000\,\,=\,\,Rs.\,\,60,000\,\,}$$
 B's Capital = 
$$\mathtt{\,\,\frac{1}{4}\quad of\,1,20,000\,\,=\,\,Rs.\,\,30,000\,\,}$$
.

|  |  | 90,000 |  |  | 90,000 |

Balance Sheet of W and R as on Jan. 01, 2015

On this date B was admitted as a partner on the following conditions:

- 1. He was to get 4/15 share of profit.
- 2. He had to bring in Rs 30,000 as his capital.
- 3. He would pay cash for goodwill which would be based on 2 ½ years purchase of the profits of the past four years.
- 4. W and R would withdraw half the amount of goodwill premium brought by B.
- 5. The assets would be revalued as: Sundry Debtors at book value less a provision of 5%; Stock at Rs 20,000; Plant and Machinery at Rs 40,000; and Patents at Rs 12,000.
- 6. Liabilities were valued at Rs 23,000, one bill for goods purchased having been omitted from books.
- 7. Profit for the past four years were :

| 2011 | 15,000 | 2013 | 14,000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2012 | 20,000 | 2014 | 17,000 |

Give necessary journal entries and ledger accounts to record the above, and prepare the Balance Sheet after B's admission.

## *Solution*

The goodwill of the firm is Rs 41,250 worked out as under :

| Profits : |  |
| --- | --- |
| Year 2011 | 15,000 |
| Year 2012 | 20,000 |
| Year 2013 | 14,000 |
| Year 2014 | 17,000 |
|  | 66,000 |

Average Profits = 66,000 Rs. 4 = Rs. 16,500

Goodwill at 2 ½ Years purchase = Rs.16,500 5 2 = Rs. 41,250

B's share of goodwill = Rs. 41,250 4 15 = Rs, 11,000.

The new ratio is 33 : 22 : 20.

## 2.9 Change in Profit Sharing Ratio among the Existing Partners

Sometimes, the partners of a firm decide to change their existing profit sharing ratio without any admission or retirement of a partner. This results in a gain of additional share in future profits of the firm for some partners while a loss of a part thereof for other partners. For example, A, B and C are partners in a firm sharing profits in the ratios of 8:5:3 It is felt that A will no more be able to actively participate in the affairs of the firm. Hence, with effect from April 1, 2007, they decided that, in future they will share the profits in the ratio

of 5 : 6 : 5. This results in A losing 3 16 8 5 16 16 − share in profits while B and C

gaining 1 16 6 5 16 16 − and 2 16 5 3 16 16 − . In such a situation, the loss and gain in the value of goodwill (if any) will have to be adjusted. This is done by crediting sacrificing partner's and debiting gaining partner's with appropriate amounts, as is explained earlier in the context of the admission of a new partners.

Any change, in the profit sharing ratio, like admission of partner, may also involve adjustments in respect of revaluation of assets and liabilities, transfer of accumulated profit and losses to partners' capital accounts in the old profit sharing ratio and adjustment of partners' capitals, if specified, so as to make them proportionate to the new profit sharing ratio. All this is done in the same way as in case of admission of a partner.

- 2. Goodwill
Total Profits : Rs. 14,000 + Rs. 17,000 + Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 22,000 + Rs. 27,000 = Rs. 1,00,000 Average Profits = Rs. 1,00,000/5 = Rs. 20,000

> 1 4 2

Goodwill = Rs. 20,000 ×

= Rs. 90,000

Suresh in expected to bring in Rs. 7,500

as he gain $\bf\frac{2}{24}$ share in profits. 

Dinesh in expected to receive Rs. 3,750

as he sacrifices $\bf\frac{1}{24}$ share in profits.

## *Terms Introduced in the Chapter*

- Reconstitution of Partnership Firm
- Revaluation of Assets
- Reassessment of liabilities
- Undistributed and accumulated profits and losses
- Accumulated Losses
- Goodwill
- Profit Sharing Ratio
- Reserves
- Revaluation Account
- Sacrificing Ratio

#### *Summary*

- 1. *Matters requiring adjustments at the time of admission of a partner:* Various matters which need adjustments in the books of firm at the time of admission of a new partner are : goodwill, revaluation of assets and liabilities, reserves and other accumulated profits and losses and the capitals of the old partners' (if agreed).
- 2. *Determining the new profit sharing ratio and calculating sacrificing ratio:* The new partner acquires his share in profits from the old partners'. This reduces the old partners' share in profits. Hence, the problem of determining the new profit sharing ratio simply involves the determination of old partners' new share in the profits of the reconstituted firm. Given the new partners' share in profits and the ratio, in which he acquires it from the old partners, the new share of each old partner shall be worked out by deducting his share of sacrifice from his old share in profits. The ratio in which the old partners have agreed to sacrifice their shares in profit in favour of the new partner is called the sacrificing ratio. It is usually same as the old profit sharing ratio. However, based on the agreement it can be different also.
- 3. *Treatment of Goodwill:* Goodwill is an intangible asset and belonges to its owner at a point of time. On the admission of a new partner the goodwill of the firm belongs to the old partners. It means that on the admission of a new partner some adjustments must be made into the capital accounts of the old partners for goodwill so that the new partner will not acquire a share in that profit which the firm earns because of its goodwill earned before admission without making any payment for the same. The amount that the new partner pays for goodwill is called goodwill. From accounting point of view the firm may have to face different situations for the treatment of goodwill at the time of admission of a partner. The amount of premium brought in by the new partner is shared by old partners in the ratio of sacrifice. In case the new partner fails to bring his

share of premium for goodwill in cash than the capital account of the new partner is debited for his share of premium of goodwill and the old partners capital accounts are credited in their sacrificing ratio.

- 4. *Adjustments for Revaluation of Assets and Reassessment of Liabilities:* If, at the time of admission of a partner, the assets and liabilities are revalued or some asset or liability is found unrecorded, necessary adjustments are made through the Revaluatiion Account. Any gain or loss arising from such exercise shall be distributed among the old partner's in their old profit sharing ratio.
- 5. *Adjustment for reserves and accumulated profits/losses:* If, at the time of admission of a partner, any reserve and accumulated profits or losses exist in books of the firm, these should be transferred to old partner's capital/current accounts in their old profit sharing ratio.
- 6. *Determining/Adjusting partners' capital:* If agreed, the partner's capital may be adjusted so as to be proportionate to their new profit sharing ratio. In that case, the new partner's capital is normally used as a base for determining the new capitals of the old partners and necessary adjustment made through case or by transfer to partner's current accounts. Other basis also may be available for determining capitals of the partners after admissioin of the new partner like sharing the total capital to be in the firm immeidately after admission of the new partner.
- 7. *Change in profit sharing ratio:* Sometimes the partners of a firm may agree to change their existing profit sharing ratio. With a result, some partners will gain in future profits while others will lose. In such a situation, the partner who gain by change in profit effecting amounts to one partner buying the share of profit from another partner. Apart from the payment for compensation, the change in profit sharing ratio also necessitates adjustment in partners' capital accounts with respect to undistributed profits and reserves, revaluation of assets and reassessment of liabilities.
