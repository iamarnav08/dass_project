A company form of organisation is the third stage in the evolution of forms of organisation. Its capital is contributed by a large number of persons called shareholders who are the real owners of the company. But neither it is possible for all of them to participate in the management of the company nor considered desirable. Therefore, they elect a Board of Directors as their representative to manage the affairs of the company. In fact, all the affairs of the company are governed by the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. A company means a company incorporated or registered under the Companies Act, 2013 or under any other earlier Companies Acts. According to Chief Justice Marshal, "a company is a person, artificial, invisible, intangible and existing only in the eyes of law. Being a mere creation of law, it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very existence".

A company usually raises its capital in the form of shares (called share capital) and debentures (debt capital.) This chapter deals with the accounting for share capital of companies.

# **1.1 Features of a Company**

A company may be viewed as an association of person who contribute money or money's worth to a common inventory and use it for a common purpose. It is an artificial person having corporate legal entity distinct from its members (shareholders) and has a common seal used for its signature. Thus, it has certain special features which distinguish it from the other forms of organisation. These are as follows:

- *Body Corporate:* A company is formed according to the provisions of Law enforced from time to time. Generally, in India, the companies are formed and registered under Companies Law except in the case of Banking and Insurance companies for which a separate Law is provided for.
- *Separate Legal Entity:* A company has a separate legal entity which is distinct and separate from its members. It can hold and deal with any type of property. It can enter into contracts and even open a bank account in its own name.
- *Limited Liability:* The liability of the members of the company is limited to the extent of unpaid amount of the shares held by them. In the case of the companies limited by guarantee, the liability of its members is limited to the extent of the guarantee given by them in the event of the company being wound up.
- *Perpetual Succession:* The company being an artificial person created by law continues to exist irrespective of the changes in its membership. A company can be terminated only through law. The death or insanity or insolvency of any member of the company in no way affects the existence of the company. Members may come and go but the company continues.
- *Common Seal:* The company being an artificial person, cannot sign its name by itself. Therefore, every company is required to have its own seal which acts as official signatures of the company. Any document which does not carry the common seal of the company is not binding on the company.
- *Transferability of Shares:* The shares of a public limited company are freely transferable. The permission of the company or the consent of any member of the company is not necessary for the transfer of shares. But the Articles of the company can prescribe the manner in which the transfer of shares will be made.
- *May Sue or be Sued:* A company being a legal person can enter into contracts and can enforce the contractual rights against others. It can sue and be sued in its name if there is a breach of contract by the company.

# **1.2 Kinds of Companies**

Companies can be classified either on the basis of the liability of its members or on the basis of the number of members. On the basis of liability of its members the companies can be classified into the following three categories:

- (i) *Companies Limited by Shares:* In this case, the liability of its members is limited to the extent of the nominal value of shares held by them. If a member has paid the full amount of the shares, there is no liability on his part whatsoever may be for the debts of the company. He need not pay a single paise from his private property. However, if there is
any liability involved, it can be enforced during the existence of the company as well as during the winding up.

- (ii) *Companies Limited by Guarantee:* In this case, the liability of its members is limited to the amount they undertake to contribute in the event of the company being wound up. Thus, the liability of the members will arise only in the event of its winding up.
- (iii) *Unlimited Companies:* When there is no limit on the liability of its members, the company is called an unlimited company. When the company's property is not sufficient to pay off its debts, the private property of its members can be used for the purpose. In other words, the creditors can claim their dues from its members. Such companies are not found in India even though permitted by the Companies Act.

On the basis of the number of members, companies can be divided into three categories as follows:

- (i) *Public Company*: A public company means a company which (a) is not a private company; (b) is a company which is not a subsidiary of a private company.
- (ii) *Private Company*: A private company is one which by its articles of association:
	- (a) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;
	- (b) A private company must have at least 2 persons, except in case of one person company;
	- (c) Limits the number of its members to 200 (excluding its employees);
- (iii) *One Person Company (OPC)*: Sec. 2 (62) of the companies Act, 2013, defines OPC as a "company which has only one person as a member". Rule 3 of the Companies (Incorporation) Rules, 2014 provides that:
	- (a) Only a natural person being an Indian citizen and resident in India can form one person company,
	- (b) It cannot carry out non-banking financial investment activities.
	- (c) Its paid up share capital is not more than Rs. 50 Lakhs
	- (d) Its average annual turnover of three years does not exceed Rs. 2 Crores.

# **1.3 Share Capital of a Company**

A company, being an artificial person, cannot generate its own capital which has necessarily to be collected from several persons. These persons are known as shareholders and the amount contributed by them is called share capital. Since the number of shareholders is very very large, a separate capital account cannot be opened for each one of them. Hence, innumerable streams of capital contribution merge their identities in a common capital account called as 'Share Capital Account'.

# *1.3.1 Categories of Share Capital*

From accounting point of view the share capital of the company can be classified as follows:

- *Authorised Capital:* Authorised capital is the amount of share capital which a company is authorised to issue by its Memorandum of Association. The company cannot raise more than the amount of capital as specified in the Memorandum of Association. It is also called Nominal or Registered capital. The authorised capital can be increased or decreased as per the procedure laid down in the Companies Act. It should be noted that the company need not issue the entire authorised capital for public subscription at a time. Depending upon its requirement, it may issue share capital but in any case, it should not be more than the amount of authorised capital.
- *Issued Capital:* It is that part of the authorised capital which is actually issued to the public for subscription including the shares allotted to vendors and the signatories to the company's memorandum. The authorised capital which is not offered for public subscription is known as 'unissued capital'. Unissued capital may be offered for public subscription at a later date.
- *Subscribed Capital:* It is that part of the issued capital which has been actually subscribed by the public. When the shares offered for public subscription are subscribed fully by the public the issued capital and subscribed capital would be the same. It may be noted that ultimately, the subscribed capital may be equal to or less than issued capital. In case the number of shares subscribed is less than what is offered, the company allots only the number of shares for which subscription has been received. In case it is higher than what is offered, the allotment will be equal to the offer. In other words, the fact of over subscription is not reflected in the books.
- *Called up Capital:* It is that part of the subscribed capital which has been called up on the shares, i.e., what the company has asked the shareholders to pay. The company may decide to call the entire amount or part of the face value of the shares, For example, if the face value (also called nominal value) of a share allotted is Rs. 10 and the company has called up only Rs. 7 per share, in that scenario, the called up capital is Rs. 7 per share. The remaining Rs. 3 may be collected from its shareholders as and when needed.
- *Paid up Capital:* It is that portion of the called up capital which has been actually received from the shareholders. When the shareholders have paid all the called amount, the called up capital is the same to the paid up capital. If any of the shareholders has not paid amount on calls, such an amount may be called as 'calls in arrears'. Therefore, paid up capital is equal to the called-up capital minus call in arrears.
- *Uncalled Capital:* That portion of the subscribed capital which has not yet been called up. As stated earlier, the company may collect this amount any time when it needs further funds.

- *Reserve Capital:* A company may reserve a portion of its uncalled capital to be called only in the event of winding up of the company. Such uncalled amount is called 'Reserve Capital' of the company. It is available only for the creditors on winding up of the company.

**Exhibit. 1.1 :** *Categories of Share Capital*

Let us take the following example and show how the share capital will be shown in the balance sheet. Sunrise Company Ltd., New Delhi, has registered its capital as Rs. 40,00,000, divided into 4,00,000 shares of Rs. 10 each. The company offered to the public for subscription of 2,00,000 shares of Rs. 10 each, to be received as Rs. 2 on application, Rs.3 on allotment, Rs.3 on first call and the balance on final call. The company received applications for 2,50,000 shares. The company finalised the allotment of 2,00,000 shares and rejected applications for 50,000 shares. The company did not make the final call. The company received all the amount except on 2,000 shares where call money has not been received. The above amounts will be shown in the Notes to Accounts of the balance sheet of Sunrise Company Ltd. as follows:

**Notes to Accounts**

| Share Capital |  | (Rs.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorised or Registered or Nominal Capital: |  |  |
| 4,00,000 Shares of Rs. 10 each |  | 40,00,000 |
| Issued Capital |  |  |
| 2,00,000 Shares of Rs. 10 each |  | 20,00,000 |
| Subscribed Capital |  |  |
| Subscribed but not fully paid up |  |  |
| 2,00,000 Shares of Rs. 10 each, Rs. 8 called up | 16,00,000 |  |
| Less : Calls in Arrears | (6,000) | 15,94,000 |

#### **1.4 Nature and Classes of Shares**

Shares, refer to the units into which the total share capital of a company is divided. Thus, a share is a fractional part of the share capital and forms the basis of ownership interest in a company. The persons who contribute money through shares are called shareholders.

The amount of authorised capital, together with the number of shares in which it is divided, is stated in the Memorandum of Association but the classes of shares in which the company's capital is to be divided, along with their respective rights and obligations, are prescribed by the Articles of Association of the company. As per The Companies Act, a company can issue two types of shares (1) preference shares, and (2) equity shares (also called ordinary shares).

# *1.4.1 Preference Shares*

According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, a preference share is one, which fulfils the following conditions :

- (a) That it carries a preferential right to dividend to be paid either as a fixed amount payable to preference shareholders or an amount calculated by a fixed rate of the nominal value of each share before any dividend is paid to the equity shareholders.
- (b) That with respect to capital it carries or will carry, on the winding up of the company, the preferential right to the repayment of capital before anything is paid to equity shareholders.

However, notwithstanding the above two conditions, a holder of the preference share may have a right to participate fully or to a limited extent in the surpluses of the company as specified in the Memorandum or Articles of the company. Thus, the preference shares can be participating and nonparticipating. Similarly, these shares can be cumulative or non-cumulative, and redeemable or irredeemable.

#### *1.4.2 Equity Shares*

According to Section 43 of The Companies Act, 2013, an equity share is a share which is not a preference share. In other words, shares which do not enjoy any preferential right in the payment of dividend or repayment of capital, are termed as equity/ordinary shares. The equity shareholders are entitled to share the distributable profits of the company after satisfying the dividend rights of the preference share holders. The dividend on equity shares is not fixed and it may vary from year to year depending upon the amount of profits available for distribution. The equity share capital may be (i) with voting rights; or (ii) with differential rights as to voting, dividend or otherwise in accordance with such rules and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed in the Articles of Association of the company.

- (h) Capital reserves are created from capital profits.
- (i) At the time of issue of shares, the maximum rate of securities premium is 10%.
- (j) The part of capital which is called up only on winding up is called reserve capital.

#### **1.5 Issue of Shares**

A salient characteristic of the capital of a company is that the amount on its shares can be gradually collected in easy instalments spread over a period of time depending upon its growing financial requirement. The first instalment is collected along with application and is thus, known as application money, the second on allotment (termed as allotment money), and the remaining instalments are termed as first call, second call and so on. The word final is suffixed to the last instalment. However, this in no way which prevents a company from calling the full amount on shares right at the time of application.

The important steps in the procedure of share issue are :

- *Issue of Prospectus:* The company first issues the prospectus to the public. Prospectus is an invitation to the public that a new company has come into existence and it needs funds for doing business. It contains complete information about the company and the manner in which the money is to be collected from the prospective investors.
- *Receipt of Applications:* When prospectus is issued to the public, prospective investors intending to subscribe the share capital of the company would make an application along with the application money

and deposit the same with a scheduled bank as specified in the prospectus. The company has to get minimum subscription within 120 days from the date of the issue of the prospectus. If the company fails to receive the same within the said period, the company cannot proceed for the allotment of shares and application money should be returned within 130 days of the date of issue of prospectus.

- *Allotment of Shares:* If minimum subscription has been received, the company may proceed for the allotment of shares after fulfilling certain other legal formalities. Letters of allotment are sent to those whom the shares have been alloted, and letters of regret to those to whom no allotment has been made. When allotment is made, it results in a valid contract between the company and the applicants who now became the shareholders of the company.
#### **Minimum Subscription**

The minimum amount that, in the opinion of directors, must be raised to meet the needs of business operations of the company relating to:

- the price of any property purchased, or to be purchased, which has to be met wholly or partly out of the proceeds of issue;
- preliminary expenses payable by the company and any commission payable in connection with the issue of shares;
- the repayment of any money borrowed by the company for the above two matters;
- working capital; and
- any other expenditure required for the usual conduct of business operations.

It is to be noted that 'minimum subscription' of capital cannot be less than 90% of the issued amount according to SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 [6.3.8.1 and 6.3.8.2]. If this condition is not satisfied, the company shall forthwith refund the entire subscription amount received. If a delay occurs beyond 8 days from the date of closure of subscription list, the company shall be liable to pay the amount with interest at the rate of 15% [Section 73(2)].

Shares of a company are issued either at par or at a premium. Shares are to be issued at *par* when their issue price is exactly equal to their nominal value according to the terms and conditions of issue. When the shares of a company are issued more than its nominal value (face value), the excess amount is called premium.

Irrespective of the fact that shares are issued at par or at a premium, the share capital of a company as stated earlier, may be collected in instalments payable at different stages.

# **1.6 Accounting Treatment**

*On application :* The amount of money paid with various instalment represents the contribution to share capital and should ultimately be credited to share capital. However, for the sake of convenience, initially individual accounts are opened for each instalment. All money received along with application is deposited with a scheduled bank in a separate account opened for the purpose. The journal entry is as follows:

```
Bank A/c Dr.
    To Share Application A/c
(Amount received on application for — shares @ Rs. ______ per share)
```
*On allotment :* When minimum subscription has been received and certain legal formalities on the allotment of shares have been duly compiled with, the directors of the company proceed to make the allotment of shares.

The allotment of shares implies a contract between the company and the applicants who now become the allottees and assume the status of shareholders or members.

#### **Allotment of Shares (Implications from accounting point of view)**

- It is customary to ask for some amount called "Allotment Money" from the allottees on the shares allotted to them as soon as the allotment is made.
- With the acceptance to the offer made by the applicants, the amount of application money received has to be transferred to share capital account as it has formally become the part of the same.
- The money received on rejected applications should be fully returned to the applicant within period prescribed by law/SEBI.
- In case lesser number of shares have to be allotted, than those applied for the excess application money must be adjusted towards the amount due on allotment from the allottees.
- The effect of the later two steps is to close the share application account which is only a temporary account for share capital transactions.

The journal entries with regard to allotment of shares are as follows:

- 1. *For Transfer of Application Money* Share Application A/c Dr. To Share Capital A/c (Application money on _____ Shares allotted/ transferred to Share Capital)
- 2. *For Money Refunded on Rejected Application* Share Application A/c Dr. To Bank A/c (Application money returned on rejected application for ___shares)
- 3. *For Amount Due on Allotment* Share Allotment A/c Dr. To Share Capital A/c
- 4. *For Adjustment of Excess Application Money* Share Application A/c Dr. To Share Allotment A/c (Application Money on __Shares @ Rs__per shares adjusted to the amount due on allotment).
- 5. *For Receipt of Allotment Money* Bank A/c Dr. To Share Allotment A/c

(Allotment money received on ___Shares @ Rs. — per share Combined Account)

- Note:- The journal entries (2) and (4) can also be combined as follows: Share Application A/c To Share Allotment A/c To Bank A/c (Excess application money adjusted to share allotment and balance refunded)
Sometimes *a combined account* for share application and share allotment called 'Share Application and Allotment Account' is opened in the books of a company. The combined account is based on the reasoning that allotment without application is impossible while application without allotment is meaningless. These two stages of share capital are closely inter-related. When a combined account is maintained, journal entries are recorded in the following manner:

| 1. | For Receipt of Application and Allotment |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Application and Allotment A/c |  |
|  | (Money received on applications for shares |  |
|  | @ Rs. _____ per share). |  |
| 2. | For Transfer of Application Money and Allotment Amount Due |  |
|  | Share Application and Allotment A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Capital A/c |  |
|  | (Transfer of application money to Share Capital Account |  |
|  | for amount due or allotment of — Share @ Rs. _____ per share) |  |
| 3. | For Money Refunded on Rejected Applications |  |
|  | Share Application and Allotment A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Bank A/c |  |
|  | (Application money returned on rejected application |  |
|  | for ___ shares) |  |
| 4. | On Receipt of Allotment Amount |  |
|  | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Application and Allotment A/c |  |
|  | (Balance of Allotment Money Received) |  |

#### **Applications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)**

Initial Public Offers and Rights Issues etc. of securities (Shares, Debentures or Other Financial Instruments) may be subscribed by paying Application Money by a banking instrument (Cheque, Pay order / Draft, Debit to Bank Account or through Applications Supported Blocked Amount (ASBA). ASBA is one of the methods for payment of Application Money.

ASBA is a process developed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)to apply for subscribing to IPOs and Rights Issue etc. of securities. Under the method, the applicant authorises the bank to block the bank account for the application money, for subscribing the issue. The Bank debits the applicant's account with application money only if he / she is allotted securities (Shares / Debentures etc.) for the amount payable on allotted securities. In case, securities are not allotted, the bank removes the block (lien) on the amount.

Under ASBA based applications, Application Amount payable on the securities applied is blocked by the bank i.e., it marks a lien on amount payable as Application Money on Securities applied. After the company has allotted securities, bank debits the applicant's bank account by the amount payable on allotted securities and remove the lien on the balance amount.

*On Calls :* Calls play a vital role in making shares fully paid-up and for realising the full amount of shares from the shareholders. In the event of shares not being fully called up till the completion of allotment, the directors have the authority to ask for the remaining amount on shares as and when they decide about the same. It is also possible that the timing of the payment of calls by the shareholders is determined at the time of share issue itself and given in the prospectus.

Two points are important regarding the calls on shares. First, the amount on any call should not exceed 25% of the face value of shares. Second, there must be an interval of at least one month between the making of two calls unless otherwise provided by the articles of association of the company.

When a call is made and the amount of the same is received, the journal entries are as given below:

| 1. | For Call Amount Due |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Share Call A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Capital A/c |  |
|  |  | (Call money due on ___Shares @ Rs. ____ per share) |
| 2. | For Receipt of Call Amount |  |
|  | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Call A/c |  |
|  | (Call money received) |  |

The word/words First, Second, or Third must be added between the words "Share" and 'Call' in the Share Call account depending upon the identity of the call made. For example, in case of first call it will be termed as 'Share First Call Account', in case of second call it will be 'Share Second Call Account' and so on. Another point to be noted is that the words 'and Final' will also be added to the last call, say, if second call is the last call it will be termed as 'Second and Final Call' and if it is the third call which is the last call, it will be termed as 'Third and Final Call'. It is also possible that the whole balance after allotment may be collected in one call only. In that case the first call itself, shall be termed as the 'First and Final Call'.

The following points should be kept in mind while issuing the share capital for public subscription :

- 1. The application money should be at least 5% of the face value of the share.
- 2. Calls are to be made as per the provisions of the articles of association.
- 3. Where there is no articles of association of its own, the following provisions of Table A will apply:
	- (a) A period of one month must elapse between two calls;
	- (b) The amount of call should not exceed 25% of the face value of the share;
- (c) A minimum of 14 days' notice is given to the shareholders to pay the amount; and
- (d) Calls must be made on a uniform basis on all shares within the same class.
- *4.* The procedure for accounting for the issue of both equity and preference shares is the same. To differentiate between the two the words 'Equity' and 'Preference' is prefixed to each and every instalment.

# *1.6.1 Calls in Arrears*

It may happen that shareholders do not pay the call amount on due date. When any shareholder fails to pay the amount due on allotment or on any of the calls, such amount is known as 'Calls in Arrears'/'Unpaid Calls'. Calls in Arrears represent the debit balance of all the calls account. Such amount shall appear as 'Note to Accounts (Refer Chapter 3). However, where a company maintains 'Calls in Arrears' Account, it needs to pass the following additional journal entry:

Calls in Arrears A/c Dr.

To Share First Call Account A/c

To Share Second and Final Call Account A/c

(Calls in arrears brought into account)

The Articles of Association of a company may empower the directors to charge interest at a stipulated rate on calls in arrears. If the articles are silent in this regard, the rule contained in Table F shall be applicable which states that the interest at a rate not exceeding 10% p.a. shall have to be paid on all unpaid amounts on shares for the period intervening between the day fixed for payment and the time of actual payment thereof.

On receipt of the call amount together with interest, the amount of interest shall be credited to interest account while call money shall be credited to the respective call account or to calls in arrears account. When the shareholder makes the payment of calls in arrears together with interest, the entry will be as follows:

Bank A/c Dr.

To Calls in Arrears A/c

To Interest on Calls in Arrears A/c

(Calls in arrears received with interest)

*Note:* If nothing is specified, there is no need to take the interest on calls in arrears account and record the above entry

#### *1.6.2 Calls in Advance*

Sometimes shareholders pay a part or the whole of the amount of the calls not yet made. The amount so received from the shareholders is known as "Calls in Advance". The amount received in advance is a liability of the company and should be credited to 'Call in Advance Account." The amount received will be adjusted towards the payment of calls as and when they becomes due. Table F of the Companies Act provides for the payment of interest on calls in advance at a rate not exceeding 12% per annum.

The following journal entry is recorded for the amount of calls received in advance.

Bank A/c Dr.

To Calls in Advance A/c

(Amount received on call in advance)

On the due date of the calls, the amount of 'Calls in Advance' is adjusted by the following entry :

Calls in Advance A/c Dr.

To Particular Call A/c

(Calls in advance adjusted with the call money due)

The balance in 'Calls in Advance' account is shown as a separate item under the title *Equity and Liabilities* in the company's balance sheet under the head *'current liabilities'*, as sub-head *'others current liabilities'.* It is not added to the amount of paid-up capital.

As 'Calls in Advance' is a liability of the company, it is under obligation, if provided by the Articles, to pay interest on such amount from the date of its receipt up to the date when appropriate call is due for payment. A stipulation is generally made in the Articles regarding the rate at which interest is payable. However, if Articles are silent on this account, Table F is applicable which provides for interest on calls in advance at a rate not exceeding 12% per annum.

The accounting treatment of interest on Calls in Advance is as follows:

#### *1.6.3 Over Subscription*

There are instances when applications for more shares of a company are received than the number offered to the public for subscription. This usually happens in respect of shares issue of well-managed and financially strong companies and is said to be a case of 'Over Subscription'.

In such a condition, three alternatives are available to the directors to deal with the situation: (1) they can accept some applications in full and totally reject the others; (2) they can make a pro-rata allotment to all; and (3) they can adopt a combination of the above two alternatives which happens to be the most common course adopted in practice.

The problem of over subscription is resolved with the allotment of shares. Therefore, from the accounting point of view, it is better to place the situation of over subscription within the total frame of application and allotment, i.e. receipt of application amount, amount due on allotment and its receipt from the shareholders, and the same has been observed in the pattern of entries.

*First Alternative :* When the directors decide to fully accept some applications and totally reject the others, the application money received on rejected applications is fully refunded. For example, a company invited applications for 20,000 shares and received the applications for 25,000 shares. The directors rejected the applications for 5,000 shares which are in excess of the required number and refunded their application money in full. In this case, the journal entries on application and allotment will be as follows :

The journal entries on application and allotment according to this alternative are as follows:

| 1 | Bank A/c | Dr. |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | To Share Application A/c |  |
|  | (Money received on application for 25,000 |  |
|  | shares @ Rs. _ per share) |  |
| 2 | Share Application A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Capital A/c |  |
|  | To Bank A/c |  |
|  | (Transfer of application for money 20,000 for |  |
|  | shares allotted and money refunded on |  |
|  | applications for 5,000 shares rejected) |  |
| 3 | Share Allotment A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Capital A/c |  |
|  | (Amount due on the allotment of 20,000 |  |
|  | shares @ Rs. _ per share) |  |
| 4 | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Allotment A/c |  |
|  | (Allotment money received) |  |

*Second Alternative :* When the directors opt to make a proportionate allotment to all applicants (called 'pro-rata' allotment), the excess application money received is normally adjusted towards the amount due on allotment. In case, the excess application money received is more than the amount due on allotment of shares, such excess amount may either be refunded or credited to calls in advance.

For example, in the event of applications for 20,000 shares being invited and those received are for 25,000 shares, it is decieded to allot shares in the ratio of 4:5 to all applicants. It is a case of pro-rata allotment and the excess application money received on 5,000 shares would be adjusted towards the amount due on the allotment of 20,000 shares. In this case, the journal entries on application and allotment will be as follows.

| 1 | Bank A/c | Dr. |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | To Share Application A/c |  |
|  | (Application money received on 25,000 shares |  |
|  | @ Rs. _ per Share) |  |
| 2 | Share Application A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Capital A/c |  |
|  | To Share Allotment A/c |  |
|  | (Transfer of application money to share |  |
|  | capital and the excess application money |  |
|  | on 5,000 shares credited to share allotment |  |
|  | account) |  |
| 3 | Share Allotment A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Capital A/c |  |
|  | (Amount due on allotment of 25,000 share |  |
|  | @ Rs. _ per share) |  |
| 4 | Bank A/c | Dr. |
|  | To Share Allotment A/c |  |
|  | (Allotment money received after adjusting |  |
|  | the amount already received as excess |  |

application money)

*Third Alternative :* When the application for some shares are rejected outrightly; and pro-rata allotment is made to the remaining applicants, the money on rejected applications is refunded and the excess application money received from applicants to whom pro-rata allotment has been made is adjusted towards the amount due on the allotment of shares allotted.

For example, a company invited applications for 10,000 shares and received applications for 15,000 shares. The directors decided to reject the applications for 2,500 shares outright and to make a pro-rata allotment of 10,000 shares to the applicants for the remaining 12,500 shares so that four shares are allotted

for every five shares applied. In this case, the money on applications for 2,500 shares rejected would be refunded fully and that on the remaining 2,500 shares (12,500 shares – 10,000 shares) would be adjusted against the allotment amount due on 10,000 shares allotted and credited to share allotment account, the journal entries on application and allotment recorded as follows:

- 1 Bank A/c Dr. To Share Application A/c (Money received on application for 15,000 shares @ Rs. _ per share)
- 2 Share Application A/c Dr. To Share Capital A/c To Share Allotment A/c To Bank A/c (Transfer of application money to share capital, and the excess application amount of pro-rata allottees credited to share allotment and the amount on rejected applications refunded)
- 3 Share Allotment A/c Dr. To Share Capital A/c (Amount due on the Allotment of 10,000 shares @ Rs. _ per share)
- 4 Bank A/c Dr. To Share Allotment A/c (Allotment money received after adjusting the amount already received as excess application money)

# *1.6.4 Under Subscription*

Under subscription is a situation where number of shares applied for is less than the number for which applications have been invited for subscription. For example, a comapny offered 2 lakh shares for subscription to the public but the applications were received for 1,90,000 shares, only. In such a situation, the allotment will be confirmed to 1,90,000 shares and entries shall be made accordingly. However, as stated earlier, it must be ensured that the company has received the minimum subscriptions and the company will have to refund the entire subscription amount received.

# *1.6.5 Issue of Shares at a Premium*

It is quite common for the shares of financially strong and well-managed companies to be issued at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares. Thus, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is issued at Rs. 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 per cent.

When the issue of shares is at a premium, the amount of premium may technically be called at any stage of the issue of shares. However, premium is generally called with the amount due on allotment, sometimes with the application money and rarely with the call money. The premium amount is credited to a separate account called 'Securities Premium Account' and is

shown under the title *'Equity and Liabilities'* of the company's balance sheet under the head *'Reserves and Surpluses'*. It can be used only for the following five purposes:

- (a) to issue fully paid bonus shares to the extent not exceeding unissued share capital of the company;
- (b) to write-off preliminary expenses of the company;
- (c) to write-off the expenses of, or commission paid, or discount allowed on any securities of the company; and
- (d) to pay premium on the redemption of preference shares or debentures of the company.
- (e) Purchase of its own shares (i.e., buy back of shares). The journal entries for shares issued at a premium are as follows:
- 1. For *Premium Amount called with Application money*

#### *1.6.6 Issue of Shares at a Discount*

There are instances when the shares of a company are issued at a discount, i.e. at an amount less than the nominal or par value of shares, the difference between the nominal value and issue price representing discount on the issue of shares. For example, when a share of the nominal value of Rs. 100 is issued at Rs. 98, it is said to have been issued at a discount of two per cent.

As a general rule, a company cannot ordinarily issue shares at a discount. It can do so only in cases such as 'reissue of forfeited shares' (to be discussed later) and issue of sweat equity shares.

#### *1.6.7 Issue of Shares for Consideration other than Cash*

There are instances where a company enters into an arrangement with the vendors from whom it has purchased assets, whereby the latter agrees to accept, the payment in the form of fully paid shares of the company issued to them. Normally, no such cash is received for issue of shares. These shares can also be issued either at par, at premium or at discount, and the number of shares to be issued will depend upon the price at which the shares are issued and the amount payable to the vendor. The number of shares to be issued to the vendor will be calculated as follows:

Number of shares to be issued= Amount Payable

Issue Price

For example, Rahul Limited purchased building from Handa Limited for Rs.5,40,000 and the payment is to be made by the issue of shares of Rs.100 each. The number of shares to be issued shall be worked out as follows in different situations:

(a) *When shares are issued at par, i.e., at Rs.100*

| Number of shares to be issued | = | Amount Payable |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | Issue Price |
|  | = | Rs. 5,40,000 |
|  |  | Rs. 100 |
|  | = | 5,400 shares |

(b) *When shares issued at premium of 20%, i.e., at Rs. 120 (100 + 20)*

| Number of shares to be issued | = | Amount Payable |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | Issue Price |
|  | = | Rs. 5,40,000 |
|  |  | Rs. 120 |
|  | = | 4,500 shares |

#### **Private Placement of Shares**

The Companies Act, 2013 (Section 42)describes Private Placement as an offer of securities or invitation to subscribe securities to a select group of persons through issue of private placement offer letter.

#### **Employees Stock Option Plan (ESOP)**

A company may offer option to its employees and employee directors to subscribe shares of the company at lower than its market value or fair value at a future date. It is known as Employees Stock Option Plan (ESOP). It being an option granted by the company, an employee may or may not exercise the right to subscribe.

Employees Stock Option Plan falls in the category of Sweat Equity, Sweat Equity being a wider.

A company issuing the options has to fulfil following prescribed conditions:

- (a) these shares are of the same class of shares already issued;
- (b) it is authorised by a special resolution passed by the company;
- (c) the resolution specifies the number of shares, the current market price, consideration, if any, and the class or classes of directors or employees to whom such equity shares are to be issued;
- (d) not less than one year has, at the date of issue, elapsed since the date on which the company had commenced business; and
- (e) these shares are issued in accordance with SEBI regulations, if the shares are listed.

#### **Important Terms of ESOP**

**Grant:** Grant means giving an option to the Employees to subscribe to the shares of the company at the pre-determined price.

**Grant Date:** It is the date of agreement between the enterprise and its employees to the terms of Employees Stock Option Plan (ESOP).

**Vesting:** A process to give right to employees to apply for shares of the company.

**Vesting Date:** It is the date on which the employee becomes entitled to apply for the shares once he has satisfiedthe vesting conditions.

**Vesting Period:** The period between the grant date and the date on which all the specified vesting conditions of an Employees Stock Option Plan (ESOP) need to be satisfied.

**Exercise:** It means applying by the employee for issue of shares against the option vested in him.

**Exercise Period :**Period after vesting within which the employee must exercise the right to apply for shares against the option vested in him in pursuance of the Employees Stock Option Plan.

**Exercise Price :**The price payable by the employee for exercising the option granted in pursuance of the Employees Stock Option Plan.

**Value of Option :**Difference between the market price and the issue price of the security.

#### **1.7 Forfeiture of Shares**

It may happen that some shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments, viz. allotment money and/or call money. In such circumstances, the company can forfeit their shares, i.e. cancel their allotment and treat the amount already received thereon as forfeited to the company within the framework of the provisions in its articles. These provisions are usually based on Table F which authorise the directors to forefeit the shares for non-payment of calls made. For this purpose, they have to strictly follow the procedure laid down in this regard. Following is the accounting treatment of shares issued at par, premium or at a discount. When shares are forefeited all entries relating to the shares forfeited except those relating to premium, already recorded in the accounting records must be reversed. Accordingly, share capital account is debited with the amount called-up in respect of shares are forfeited and crediting the respective unpaid calls accounts's or calls in arrears account with the amount already received. Thus, the journal entry will be as follows:

*Forfeiture of Shares issued at a Premium:* If shares were initially issued at a premium and the premium amount has been fully realised, but some of the shares are forfeited due to non-payment of call money, the accounting treatment for forfeiture shall be on the same pattern as in the case of shares issued at par. The important point to be noted in this context is that the securities premium account is not to be debited at the time of forfeiture if the premium has been received in respect of the forefeited shares and the amount of forfeiture shall be excluding premium amount.

In case, however, if the premium amount has not been received, either wholly or partially, in respect of the shares forfeited, the Securities Premium Reserve Account will also be debited with the amount of premium not received along with the Share Capital Account at the time forfeiture. This will usually be the case when even the amount due on allotment has not been received. Thus, the journal entry to record the forfeiture of shares issued at a premium on which premium has not been fully received, will be :

| Share Capital A/c | Dr. |
| --- | --- |
| Securities Premium Reserve A/c | Dr. |
| To Share Forfeiture A/c |  |

```
To Share Allotment A/c
    and/or
   To Share Calls A/c (individually)
(..... shares forefeited for non-payment of
allotment money and calls made)
```
*Note:* If Calls in Arrears Account is maintained, Calls in Arrears Account is credited and not the Share Allotment and/or Share Call/Calls Accounts.

#### *1.7.1 Reissue of Forfeited Shares*

The directors can either cancel or re-issue the forefeited shares. In most cases, they reissue such shares which may be at par, at premium or at a discount. Forfeited shares may be reissued as fully paid at a par, premium, discount. In this context, it may be noted that the amount of discount allowed cannot exceed the amount that had been received on forfeited shares at the time of initial issue, and that the discount allowed on reissue of forfeited shares should be debited to the 'Forfeited Share Account'. The balance, if any, left in the Share-Forfeited Account relating to reissued Shares, should be treated as capital profit and transferred to Capital Reserve Account. For example, when a company forfeits 200 shares of Rs. 10 each on which Rs. 600 had been received, it can allow a maximum discount of Rs. 600 on their reissue. Assuming that the company reissues these shares for Rs. 1,800 as fully paid, the necessary journal entry will be:

| Bank A/c | Dr. | 1,800 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Share Forfeiture A/c | Dr. | 200 |  |
| To Share Capital A/c |  |  | 2,000 |
| (Reissue of 200 forfeited shares at Rs. 9 per |  |  |  |
| share as fully paid) |  |  |  |

This shall leave a balance of Rs. 400 in share forfeited account which should be transferred to Capital Reserve Account by recording the following journal entry:

| Share Forfeiture A/c | Dr. | 400 |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| To Capital Reserve |  |  | 400 |
| (Profit on reissue of forfeited shares |  |  |  |
| transferred) |  |  |  |

Another important point to be noted in this context is that the capital profit arises only in respect of the forefited share reissued, and not on all forefeited shares. Hence, when a part of the forfeited shares are reissued, the whole balance of share forfeiture account cannot be transferred to the capital reserve. In such a situation, it is only the proportionate amount of balance that relates to the forefeited shares reissued which should be transferred to capital reserve, ensuring that the remaining balance in share forefeiture account is proportionate to the amount forefeited on shares not yet reissued.

As two allotees, each holding 4,000 shares, paid the full amount on allotment, amount of calls-in-advance is thus :

**Buy-back of Shares :** When a company purchase its own shares, it is called 'Buy-back of Shares'. Section 68 of The Companies Act, 2013 provides that the company can buy their own shares from either of the following sources :

- (b) Open Market
- (c) Odd-lot shareholders
- (d) Employees of the company

The company can buy back its own shares either from the free reserves, securities premium or from the proceeds of any shares or other specified securities. In case shares are bought back out of free reserves, the company must transfer a sum equal to the nominal value of shares bought back to 'Capital Redemption Reserve Account'.

The following procedures have been laid down for buy back of shares :

- (a) The Articles of the Association must authorise the company for the buy back of shares.
- (b) A special resolution must be passed in the companies' Annual General Body meeting.
- (c) The amount of buy back of shares in any financial year should not exceed 25% of the paid-up capital and free reserves.
- (d) The debt-equity ratio should not be more than a ratio of 2:1 after the buy back.
- (e) All the shares of buy back should be fully paid-up.
- (f) The buy-back of the shares should be completed within 12 months from the date of passing the special resolution.
- (g) The company should file a solvency declaration with the Registrar and SEBI which must be signed by at least two directors of the company.

#### *Summary*

*Company:* An organisation consisting of individuals called 'shareholders' by virtue of their holding the shares of a company, who can act as legal person as regards its business through board of directors.

*Share:* Fractional part of the capital, and forms the basis of ownership in a company. Shares are generally of two types, viz. equity shares and preference shares, according to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Preference shares again are of different types based on varying shades of rights attached to them.

Share Capital of a company is collected by issuing shares to either a select group of persons through the route of private placements and/or offered to the public for subscription. Thus, the issue of shares is basic to the capital of a company. Shares are issued either for cash or for consideration other than cash, the former being more common. Shares are said to be issued for consideration other than cash when a company purchases business, or some asset/assets, and the vendors have agreed to receive payment in the form of fully paid shares of a company.

*Stages of Share Issue:* The issue of shares for cash is required to be made in strict conformity with the procedure laid down by law for the same. When shares are issued for cash, the amount on them can be collected at one or more of the following stages:

- (i) Application for shares
- (ii) Allotment of shares
- (iii) Call/Calls on shares.

*Calls in Arrears:* Sometimes, the full amount called on allotment and/or call (calls) is not received from the allottees/shareholders. The amount not so received are cumulatively called 'Unpaid calls' or 'Calls in Arrears'. However, it is not mandatory for a company to maintain a separate Calls-in-Arrears Account. There are also instances where some shareholders consider it discreet to pay a part or whole of the amount not yet called-up on the shares allotted to them. Any amount paid by a shareholder in the excess of the amount due from him on allotment/call (calls) is known as 'Calls in Advance' for which a separate account is maintained. A company has the power to charge interest on calls in arrears and is under an obligation to pay interest on calls-in-advance if it accepts them in accordance with the provisions of Articles of Association.

*Over Subscription:* It is possible for the shares of some companies to be over subscribed which means that applications for more shares are received than the number offered for subscription.

If the amount of minimum subscription is not received to the extent of 90%, the issue dissolves. In case the applications received are less than the number of shares offered to the public, the issue is termed as 'under subscribed'.

*Issue of Shares at Premium:* Irrespective of the fact that shares have been issued for consideration other than cash, they can be issued either at par or at premium. The issue of shares at par implies that the shares have been issued for an amount exactly equal to their face or nominal value. In case shares are issued at a premium, i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares, the amount of premium is credited to a separate account called 'Securities Premium Reserve Account', the use of which is strictly regulated by law.

*Issue of Shares at Discount:* Shares can as well be issued at a discount, i.e. for an amount less than the nominal or par value of shares provided the company fully complies with the provisions laid down by law with regard to the same. Apart from such compliance, shares of a company cannot ordinarily be issued at a discount. According to the Companies Act, 2013, only sweat equity shares can be issued at a discount. When shares are issued at a discount, the amount of discount is debited to 'Discount on Issue of Share Account', which is in the nature of capital loss for the company.

*Forfeiture of Shares:* Sometimes, shareholders fail to pay one or more instalments on shares allotted to them. In such a case, the company has the authority to forfeit shares of the defaulters. This is called 'Forfeiture of Shares'. Forfeiture means the cancellation of allotment due to breach of contract and to treat the amount already received on such shares as forfeited to the company. The precise accounting treatment of share forfeiture depends upon the conditions on which the shares have been issued — at par, premium or discount. Generally speaking, accounting treatment on forfeiture is to reverse the entries passed till the stage of forfeiture, the amount already received on the shares being credited to Forfeiture Shares Account.

*Reissue of Shares:* The management of a company is vested with the power to reissue the shares once forfeited by it, subject of course, to the terms and conditions in the articles of association relating to the same. The shares can be reissued even at a discount provided the amount of discount allowed does not exceed the credit balance of Share forfeiture account relating to shares being reissued. Therefore, discount allowed on the reissue of forfeited shares is debited to Share forfeiture account.

Once all the forfeited shares have been reissued, any credit balance on Share forfeiture account is transferred to Capital Reserve representing profit on forfeiture of shares. In the event of all forfeited share not being reissued, the credit amount on Share forfeiture account relating to shares yet to be reissued is carried forward and the remaining balance on the account only is credited to capital reserve account.
